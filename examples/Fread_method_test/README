The two test cases in this folder are used to test the implementation of Fread method in the SPRNT model.

In the SPRNT model, we use the method proposed by Danny Fread (1986) to handle the numerical instaiblity of Preissmann scheme in the transition from subcritical to supercritical,
or vice versa. 

Both files are generated from test cases in MacDonald  (1995) (https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/maths/02-95.pdf).

f1.spt and f2.spt are based on the UR6 and UT4 case in MacDonald (1995) respectively.
