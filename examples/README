For each test, the makefile will do two things: 
1. run SPRNT to generate output file
2. compare the output file with golden results, stored in "golden"

Note that the golden results are generated on a 64bit computer. If you
compile the code on a 32bit computer, the output files will be different. 
And the test will fail. You can manually compared the results to see
if the results are drastically different from golden. 

To run them manually, use "bin/run_sprint.sh"
