The two files in this folder are used to validate the usage of reference slope feature in the SPRNT model.

r1.spt has 24 simple cross sections with reference slope line generated from the original HEC-RAS dataset. 

On the contrast, r2.spt has the same cross section configuration, but the reference slope line is enhanced 10 meters. 

Although the elevation of two reference slope lines are different, but the solutions should be indentical.
