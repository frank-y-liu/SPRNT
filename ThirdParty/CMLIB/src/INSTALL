 Installing CMLIB:
 ----------------

  (0) In some cases CMLIB is distributed with precompiled libraries.  The 
      libraries are found in the files ARCH/lib<opts>/libcm.a , where ARCH is
      the architecture of the workstation and 'lib<opts>' is dependent on which
      compilation options were used to build the library.  For example, the
      subdirectory SunOS-sun4m-5.6/lib_f90 would contain the libcm.a file which
      was created on a Sparcstation 5, running Solaris 2, using the Fortran 90
      compiler.  If the library is present, then run ranlib on it.  The
      quickcheck programs should be run to verify the library.  If the output
      of the command "utils/itl-arch" is not exactly the same as an existing
      ARCH directory but is compatible (e.g. SunOS-sun4u-5.6 is available and
      your ARCH is SunOS-sun4m-5.5.1), then create a link for your ARCH to the
      existing directory, e.g. "ln -s SunOS-sun4u-5.6 SunOS-sun4m-5.5.1".
      Type "RunMake -m testall" and choose the library to test.  A job that
      runs the tests will be run by way of either the "qsub" or "at" command,
      if they exist, otherwise it will run interactively.
      You may skip (1) below.

 (1) To build CMLIB and run testall go to the directory where you extracted the 
     CMLIB tar file (SRCDIR) and execute RunMake.
     
          cd SRCDIR
          ./RunMake
     
     RunMake presents a menu of compiler/compiler-options that can be used to
     build CMLIB for a given architecture (ARCH) (For some architectures there
     is currently only one option, e.g. Linux).  Based on the selected option,
     a command file (job.cmd) is created and run by way of either the "qsub"
     or "at" command, if they exist, otherwise it will run interactively. You
     should receive mail that contains the output from the build/testall when
     the at/qsub job completes (this could take several hours and will contain
     lots of output).


 (2) The library, libcm.a[so], and a copy of the output from testall,
     testall.ARCH.out, are written to the SRCDIR/ARCH/lib<opts>
     directory. Check the testall output to verify the library was built
     correctly.  Refer to the table_of_notes file for known problems.


 (3) To install the library on your machine, create a link to the file
     SRCDIR/ARCH/lib<opts>/libcm.a in the directory in which you keep local
     libraries (usually /usr/local/lib).  In this way users can link to
     the library by putting the option -lcm on the Fortran compilation
     statement.  When multiple versions of the library are built for one
     ARCH, it will be necessary to create multiple links, refer to the
     appropriate man page located in the SRCDIR/man directory for possible
     naming conventions.
     
     
 (4) SRCDIR/scripts contains C shell scripts for retrieving CMLIB documentation,
     source, and source + dependencies.  They are called cmdoc, cmsrc and
     cmsrcx.os, where os is either aix, irix, irix64, solaris2, sun4, hpux, or
     linux. cmdoc, cmsrc, and the appropriate cmsrcx.os script must be edited
     to reflect the locations of the directories SRCDIR/doc, SRCDIR/src, and 
     SRCDIR on your machine, respectively. The third script, cmsrcx.os, edits
     a loader listing for operating system "os" to obtain a list of external
     references for the routine whose source+externals is required.  This may
     need to be modified to work correctly on your machine.  These scripts
     should be installed in the directory where you keep local executables
     (usually /usr/local/bin), renaming cmsrcx.os to cmsrcx. 
     
 (5) The SRCDIR/man directory contains a man pages for the different operating
     systems (cmlib_os.l).  It may need to be edited to reflect your situation.
     It should linked or copied to where you keep local man pages as cmlib.l.
     

  Using the associated shell scripts
  ----------------------------------

  The following shell scripts are available in the script subdirectory

    cmdoc LIST    : retrieves documentation on subprograms in LIST
    cmdoc -s NAME : retrieves summary documentation on sublibrary NAME
    cmdoc -s      : retrieves summary documentation on CMLIB
    cmsrc LIST    : retrieves source for subprograms in LIST
    cmsrcx LIST   : retrieves source for subprograms in LIST plus all their
                    external references within CMLIB

  All output is written to standard output.  Some examples follow:

    cmdoc -s fcnpak | more        : scan summary documentation for fcnpak
    cmsrc sgefa sgesl > srcfil    : put source for sgefa and sgesl in srcfil



 File Organization
 ------------------
     
 SRCDIR                        the directory where you extracted the tar file.
     
 Under SRCDIR the following structure exists:
     
 RunMake                       script used for building and testing CMLIB
 make.inc<_os_opts>            include files used by make for defining
                               compiler, compiler options, etc. to be used
                               for <_os_opts> (e.g. make.inc_aix contains
                               the compiler, ... definitions used to create
                               the Fortran 77 version of CMLIB for the AIX
                               operating system) 
 src/SUBLIBRARY/*.f            source files for SUBLIBRARY
 test/SUBLIBRARY.f             test program for SUBLIBRARY
 doc/summary                   summary documentation for CMLIB
 doc/SUBLIBRARY/summary        summary documentation for SUBLIBRARY
 doc/SUBLIBRARY/SUBPROGRAM     documentation for SUBPROGRAM in SUBLIBRARY
 man/cmlib_os.l                man pages for different operating systems (os)
 scripts                       C shell scripts for documentation and source
                               retrieval
 utils                         various utilities required by RunMake
 ARCH                          directory that contains the subdirectories
                               where libraries are generated for machine
                               ARCH.  ARCH is determined by the "utils/itl-arch"
                               script. The name consists of the operating system
                               name, hardware name and operating system release
                               level separated with hyphens.  (e.g.
                               SunOS-sun4m-5.6 is a Sparcstation 5 running
                               Solaris 2.5)
 
 Under ARCH the following structure exists:
 
 lib<opts>                     the directory where the library built for ARCH
                               using <opts> is located. Output for testall
                               and specific routine tests are also located here.
                               (e.g. SunOS-sun4m-5.6/lib_f90 contains the
                               version of CMLIB made using the f90 compiler.)
 lib<opts>/src/SUBLIBRARY/*.f  special versions of source files required for 
                               a specific build.  (e.g. lib/src/machcon
                               contains the *.f routines with the correct 
                               machine constants for ARCH using lib<opts>) 
 
     
     
 RunMake Command Options for Multiple-Architecture Installation
 --------------------------------------------------------------
     
  RunMake [-d remote-SRCDIR]
          [-h remote-host]
          [-m testall | test | libcm | clean]
          [-i nn (nn is test input)]
          [-r rsh|ssh]
     
    -d   if not specified, defaults to current working directory
    -h   if not specified, runs job.cmd on current host, otherwise will run
         job.cmd on remote host (you must have rshcmd permission)
    -m   if not specified, defaults to 'libcm and testall'
           libcm   - builds the requested library
           testall - runs all the SUBLIBRARY tests
           test    - runs the tests for a specific SUBLIBRARY
    -i   if not specified, defaults to '11' for '-m testall' and prompts
         you for 'output level' for '-m test'
    -r   if not specified, defaults to rsh. 
     
  If a version of cmlib already exists and you want to test a similar 
  ARCH, for example AIX-8900-4.2 already exists and you want to
  see if AIX-4C00-4.3 can use the same libraries then:
     
       cd SRCDIR
       ln -s AIX-8900-4.2 AIX-4C00-4.3
       ./RunMake [-h remote-host] -m testall
