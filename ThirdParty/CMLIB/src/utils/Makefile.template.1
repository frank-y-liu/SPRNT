#  This makefile maintains cmlib for a specific architecture.

#  The maintainence is done locally, but all compilations take place
#  on a remote host with a designated compiler and options.  The library
#  is then suitable for use on such remote hosts.

#      FFLAGS   == flags for Fortran compiler on remote host
#      RANLIB   == the ranlib command on the remote host
#      THISDIR  == location of current directory on remote host
#      MACHCON  == floating-point type from ../src/machcon
