    Although most applications will only  use  a  small  number  of  CMLIB
    modules, there are no name conflicts within the library and  thus  all
    of CMLIB can easily be installed. All  the  documentation  is  machine
    readable.  For a summary of its contents see ./doc/Summary.

   +  National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply     +
