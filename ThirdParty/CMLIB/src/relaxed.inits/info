These versions of the fnlib routines inits.f and initds.f relax
the accuracy requirement for versions of CMLIB created with
a compiler's auto-doubling option.  They are necessary because the
polynomial approximation in use is only good to Cray double
precision accuracy.  Quad precision gives one a few more decimal
digits, which makes the original versions fail.
