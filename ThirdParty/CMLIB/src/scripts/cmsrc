#  usage: cmsrc <subprogram> ...

#  retrieves source for CMLIB subprograms whose name(s)
#  are listed on the command line. The requested items are
#  written to standard output.

#  The environment variable CMLIBDIR, if set, is taken to be the
#  directory where CMLIB source and documentation is stored.  The
#  named directory is presumed to have CMLIB's src subdirectory.
#  If CMLIBDIR is not set, then /usr/local/apps/cmlib is used.
