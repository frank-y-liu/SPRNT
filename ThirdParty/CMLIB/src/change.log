-----------------------------------------------------------------------
03/17/89  AMOSLIB    X X X X   JZC   Added function DJAIRY. 
09/14/89  SNLSE        X       MKP   Removed documentation for SNLS and
                                     SNLSE since source doesn't exist for
                                     them any more.
09/27/89  DNL2SN       X       MKP   Replaced incorrect documentation for

10/18/91  PCHIP          X     RFB   Declared RAND external to avoid compile
                                     error on RS6000 (RAND is reserved word there).
10/18/91  SLRPACK        X     RFB   Relaxed tolerance on test of DLINFS so test
                                     would pass on RS6000.
10/21/91  AMOSLIB    X         RFB   Added 'EXTERNAL GAMMA' to BESYNU.
                                     Added 'EXTERNAL DGAMMA' to DBSYNU.
                                     On IBM R/S6000 GAMMA is an intrinsic,
                                     but it is not correct.  This forces
                                     CMLIB version to be selected.
10/21/91  FNLIB      X   X     RFB   Added 'EXTERNAL GAMMA' to albeta,
                                     alngam, beta, chu, gamr, poch, and
                                     r9knus. Added 'EXTERNAL DGAMMA' to
                                     d9knus, dbeta, dchu, dgamr, dlbeta,
                                     dlngam, and  dpoch.  Also added EXTERNAL
                                     statements to fnlibs and fnlibd quickchecks.
                                     On IBM RS/6000 GAMMA is an intrinsic,
                                     but it is not correct.  This forces
                                     CMLIB version to be selected.
10/30/91  CLUSTER    X         RFB   Commented out two "dead" lines in ASSIGN 
                                     that caused fatal error in Lahey Fortran.
10/30/91  FNLIB      X         RFB   Added EXTERNAL CARG to CCBRT, CLNGAM, and
                                     CLNREL.  CARG is an intrinsic (with a
                                     different purpose) in Lahey Fortran.  This
                                     forces the CMLIB version to be used.
11/06/91  FC       .  .  X     RFB   Changed integer parameter IFMT(*) to
                                     character*(*).  This corresponds to how it
                                     is used and conforms to ANSI standard.
12/16/91  FISHPAK        X     RFB   Modified test to make print conform to
                                     conventions.
02/19/92  FC         X         RFB   Forced LSI, LSEI, WNLSM to get machine
                                     epsilon from R1MACH.  They were computing
                                     it, which failed on HP9000s300.
02/19/92  FISHPAK        X     RFB   Call to HWSCYL was missing argument PERTRB
06/30/92  FISHPAK    X         RFB   Added digits to PI.
06/30/92  DTENSBS        X     RFB   Make test more robust when EPS=1E-16.
06/30/92  SLRPACK        X     RFB   Make test more robust when EPS=1E-16.

06/30/92  FC             X     RFB   Make test more robust when EPS=1E-16.
06/30/92  FCNPAK         X     RFB   Make test more robust when EPS=1E-16.
06/30/92  FISHPAK        X     RFB   Make test more robust when EPS=1E-16.
09/08/92  FNLIB      X         RFB   Add EXTERNAL RAND to RUNIF, RGAUSS to
                                     fix problem on RS/6000
09/08/92  DBSPLIN        X     RFB   Set PI using ATAN
09/08/92  DTENSBS        X     RFB   Loosen tolerance by factor of 2.
09/08/92  SLRPACK        X     RFB   Remove check for kount from test 5.
06/15/94  EISPACK    X         RFB   Make these routines get MACHEP from R1MACH:
                                     BISECT, RATQR, TQLRAT, TRIDIB, TSTURM
                                     Computation of MACHEP failed on IBM RS6000.
04/02/98  BLAS           X     RFB   Changed IDINT to INT in test routine. Failed
                                     to compile on SGI Origin f77 -r8 -d16.
