    The package UNCMIN contains the following two portable, user-callable
 FORTRAN subroutines designed to solve the unconstrained nonlinear
 optimization problem. This problem involves finding the minima of a
 twice continuously differentiable real-valued function F of n variables
 from a given starting point x(0). They were supplied by Robert Schnabel
 of the Scientific Computing Division, National Bureau of Standards,
 Boulder, Colorado 80303.
   The UNCMIN User's Guide is available in the National Bureau of Standards
 library, along with the other two references. Questions should be directed
 to Richard Jackson, Scientific Computing Division:
