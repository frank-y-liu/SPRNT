C***PURPOSE  TO PROVIDE SINGLE-PRECISION FLOATING-POINT ARITHMETIC
C            WITH AN EXTENDED EXPONENT RANGE
C***DESCRIPTION
C     REAL X
C     INTEGER IX
C
C                  IF
C                  RADIX**(-2L) .LE. (ABS(X),IX) .LE. RADIX**(2L)
C                  THEN XSRED TRANSFORMS (X,IX) SO THAT IX=0.
C                  IF (X,IX) IS OUTSIDE THE ABOVE RANGE,
C                  THEN XSRED TAKES NO ACTION.
C                  THIS SUBROUTINE IS USEFUL IF THE
C                  RESULTS OF EXTENDED-RANGE CALCULATIONS
C                  ARE TO BE USED IN SUBSEQUENT ORDINARY
C                  SINGLE-PRECISION CALCULATIONS.
