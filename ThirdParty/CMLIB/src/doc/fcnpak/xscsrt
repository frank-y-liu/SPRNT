C***DESCRIPTION
C
C        SUBROUTINE XSCSRT CALCULATES CASORATI (CROSS PRODUCT)
C        CHECK VALUES AND STORES THEM IN ARRAYS C1 AND C2 WITH
C        EXPONENTS IN ARRAYS IC1 AND IC2.  CALCULATIONS ARE BASED
C        ON PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED LEGENDRE FUNCTIONS OF THE
C        FIRST KIND (NEGATIVE ORDER) IN ARRAY P, THE SECOND KIND
C        IN ARRAY Q, THE FIRST KIND (POSITIVE ORDER) IN ARRAY R.
C        RESULTS SHOULD BE 1.0 TO WITHIN ROUNDOFF ERROR.
