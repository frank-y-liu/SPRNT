C   PURPOSE
C   -------
C
C      CLUSTERS A SEQUENCE OF CASES INTO SUBSEQUENCES BY FISHER'S
C      METHOD OF EXACT OPTIMIZATION
C
C   DESCRIPTION
C   -----------
C
C   1.  THE "EXACT OPTIMIZATION" METHOD OF W.  D.  FISHER MAXIMIZES THE
C       BETWEEN-CLUSTER SUM OF SQUARES.  NOTE THAT THE PARTITION IS
C       GUARANTEED OPTIMAL BUT NOT UNIQUE.
C
C   2.  IF A PARTITION INTO K CLUSTERS IS REQUESTED, OPTIMAL PARTITIONS
C       INTO K-1, K-2, ..., 2, 1 CLUSTERS ARE ALSO FOUND AND INCLUDED
C       IN THE OUTPUT.
C
C   3.  THE OUTPUT IS WRITTEN ON FORTRAN UNIT OUNIT AND CONSISTS OF THE
C       VECTOR OF CASE LABELS AND THE VECTOR OF THE OBSERVATIONS.  THEN
C       THE OPTIMAL PARTITIONS INTO K, K-1, ..., 2, 1 SUBSETS WITH
C       SUMMARY STATISTICS ARE PRINTED.  THEY INCLUDE THE MEAN AND
C       STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE OBSER- VATIONS FOR EACH CLUSTER FOR
C       EACH PARTIION.  THE MEMBERS OF THE FIRST CLUSTER FOR ANY
C       PARTITION BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE VECTOR OF LABELS AND CONTINUE
C       FOR THE NUMBER IN THE CLUSTER.
C
