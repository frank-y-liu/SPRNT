C   PURPOSE
C   -------
C
C     APPROXIMATES THE COVARIANCE MATRIX BY BB' WHERE B CONTAINS MANY
C     ZEROS AND CORRESPONDS TO THE LOADING MATRIX FOR FACTOR ANALYSIS
C     WHERE CLUSTERS OF VARIABLES ARE THE FACTORS
C
C   DESCRIPTION
C   -----------
C
C   1.  THE FIRST COLUMN OF B IS THE EIGENVECTOR CORRESPONDING TO THE
C       LARGEST EIGENVALUE OF THE COVARIANCE MATRIX.  THEN THE ROW THAT
C       MINIMIZES THE SQUARE OF THE CORRELATION OF THAT VARIABLE WITH
C       THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE ORIGINAL VARIABLES, WEIGHTED BY THE
C       FIRST COLUMN OF B IS FOUND.  THAT ROW IS REMOVED FROM THE
C       COVARIANCE MATRIX WITH ALL CORRELATIONS BEING REPLACED BY THE
C       PARTIAL CORRELATION WITH THE REMOVED ROW FIXED AND BY SETTING
C       ALL CORRELATIONS INVOLVING THAT ROW TO ZERO.  THE SECOND COLUMN
C       OF B IS THE EIGENVECTOR FOR THE NEW MATRIX AND THE PROCESS
C       CONTINUES.
C
C   2.  THE ORIGINAL COVARIANCE MATRIX IS OUTPUTED, FOLLOWED BY THE
C       MATRIX B, THE LOADING MATRIX FOR THE FACTOR ANALYSIS.  EACH
C       COLUMN OF THE LOADING MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO A CLUSTER OF
C       VARIABLES WITH THE ENTRIES CORRESPONDING TO THE FACTORS.  ONLY
C       VARIABLES WITH NON-ZERO FACTORS ARE ELEMENTS OF THE CLUSTER.
C       THEN THE RESIDUAL MATRIX (A - BB') IS PRINTED, THEN THE
C       PERCENTAGE OF VARIANCE FOR EACH CLUSTER, BOTH ACTUAL AND
C       CUMULATIVE, ARE PRINTED OUT, ALL ON FORTRAN UNIT OUNIT.
