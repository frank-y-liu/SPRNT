C
C   PURPOSE
C   -------
C
C      ASSIGNS EACH CASE TO THE CLUSTER WHOSE CENTER IS A MINIMUM
C      EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE FROM THE CASE. CAN BE USED WITH CLUSTER
C      SUBROUTINE RELOC TO FORM A USER-DEFINED K-MEANS PACKAGE.
C
C   DESCRIPTION
C   -----------
C
C   1.  THE VARIABLES MUST BE SCALED SIMILARLY (CLUSTER SUBROUTINE STAND
C       CAN BE USED TO STANDARDIZE THE VARIABLES).
C
C   2.  THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH CLUSTER MEAN AND A CASE IS
C       DETERMINED, AND THAT CASE IS ASSIGNED TO THE CLUSTER WHOSE
C       DISTANCE IS A MINIMUM.  THE CASE THAT IS FURTHEST FROM THE
C       CLUSTER CENTER IS RETURNED ALONG WITH THE FURTHEST DISTANCE.
C       MISSING VALUES ARE DENOTED BY A 99999.  AND DO NOT AFFECT THE
C       DISTANCE CALCULATION.
C
C   INPUT PARAMETERS
C   ----------------

C
C   A     REAL MATRIX WHOSE FIRST DIMENSION MUST BE MM AND WHOSE SECOND
C            DIMENSION MUST BE AT LEAST N (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE MATRIX OF DATA VALUES.
C
C         A(I,J) IS THE VALUE FOR THE J-TH VARIABLE FOR THE I-TH CASE.
C
C   K     INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE NUMBER OF CLUSTERS.
C
C   DMU   INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE FIRST DIMENSION OF THE MATRIX U.  MUST BE AT LEAST N.
C
C   U     REAL MATRIX WHOSE FIRST DIMENSION MUST BE DMU AND WHOSE SECOND
C            DIMENSION MUST BE AT LEAST K (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE CENTERS OF THE CLUSTERS.
C
C   OUTPUT PARAMETERS
C   -----------------
C
C   NC    INTEGER VECTOR DIMENSIONED AT LEAST M+1.
C         NC(I) IS THE CLUSTER FOR CASE I.
C
C         NC(M+1) IS THE CASE FURTHEST FROM ITS MEAN.
C
C   DMAX  REAL SCALAR.
C         THE DISTANCE CASE NC(M+1) IS FROM ITS MEAN.
