C
C   PURPOSE
C   -------
C
C      PRODUCES A MATRIX OF SCATTER PLOTS BETWEEN Y(I) AND Y(J) FOR
C      I <= I,J => N WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES.  FOR I=J, A
C      HISTOGRAM FOR VARIABLE I IS PRODUCED
C
C   DESCRIPTION
C   -----------
C
C   1.  THE ROUTINE PRODUCES AN N BY N MATRIX OF PLOTS ON FORTRAN UNIT
C       OUNIT.  THE (I,J)-TH ELEMENT (I<>J) IS A SCATTERPLOT OF
C       VARIABLE I VS.  VARIABLE J.  IF I=J, THE PLOT IS A HISTOGRAM OF
C       VARIABLE I.
C
C   2.  A SINGLE DATA VALUE IS DENOTED BY A PERIOD (.); TWO COINCIDENT
C       DATA VALUES DENOTED BY A COLON (:); THREE COINCIDENT DATA
C       VALUES DENOTED BY A PLUS (+); AND MORE THAN THREE DENOTED BY A
C       FOUR (4).
C
C   INPUT PARAMETERS
C   ----------------
C
C   MM    INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE MATRIX A.  MUST BE AT LEAST M.
C
C   M     INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE NUMBER OF CASES.
C
C   N     INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES.
C
C   A     REAL MATRIX WHOSE FIRST DIMENSION MUST BE MM AND SECOND
C            DIMENSION MUST BE AT LEAST N (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C
C         A(I,J) IS THE VALUE FOR THE J-TH VARIABLE FOR THE I-TH CASE.
C
C   CLAB  VECTOR OF 4-CHARACTER VARIABLES DIMENSIONED AT LEAST N
C            (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE LABELS OF THE VARIABLES.
C
C   TITLE 10-CHARACTER VARIABLE (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         THE TITLE OF THE DATA SET.
C
C   XMIN  INTEGER VECTOR DIMENSIONED AT LEAST N (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         XMIN(I) HOLDS THE MINIMUM VALUE TO BE PLOTTED FOR VARIABLE I.
C
C   XMAX  INTEGER VECTOR DIMENSIONED AT LEAST N (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         XMAX(I) HOLDS THE MAXIMUM VALUE TO BE PLOTTED FOR VARIABLE I.
C
C         IF XMIN(I) .GE. XMAX(I) ON INPUT, THEIR VALUES WILL BE
C            DETERMINED BY THE ROUTINE.
C
C   NC    INTEGER VECTOR DIMENSIONED AT LEAST N+1 (CHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         NC(I) HOLDS THE NUMBER OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPACES TO BE
C            USED FOR THE I-TH COLUMN OF SCATTER PLOTS.
C
C         IF NC(I) = 0 ON INPUT, THE ROUTINE WILL CALCULATE THE VALUES
C         OF NC WHICH WILL USE THE MAXIMUM OF THE 132 COLUMNS OF THE
C         PRINTER.  SINCE THE PLOTS MUST FIT ON A 132 COLUMN PRINTOUT,
C         SUM(NC(I))+2*N FOR I=1,N MUST BE LESS THAN 122 OR THE ROUTINE
C         WILL RETURN WITH AN ERROR MESSAGE.
C
C   OUNIT INTEGER SCALAR (UNCHANGED ON OUTPUT).
C         UNIT NUMBER FOR OUTPUT.
C
C   OUTPUT PARAMETER
C   ----------------
C
C   IERR  INTEGER SCALAR.
C         ERROR FLAG.
C
C         IF IERR = 0, NO ERROR WAS DETECTED DURING EXECUTION.
C
C         IF IERR = 1, THE SIZE OF THE PLOTS AS SPECIFIED BY NC WILL NOT
C                      FIT ON A 132-COLUMN PRINTER.  DECREASE THE VALUES
C                      OF NC.
