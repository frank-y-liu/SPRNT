C
C   PURPOSE
C   -------
C
C      FITS THE MIXTURE MODEL FROM K MULTIVARIATE NORMALS WHERE K IS
C      THE DESIRED NUMBER OF CLUSTERS.  THE VARIABLES ARE ASSUMED TO
C      HAVE VARIANCE CONSTANT OVER DIFFERENT CLUSTERS
C
C   DESCRIPTION
C   -----------
C
C   1.  THE DATA ARE ASSUMED TO BE A RANDOM SAMPLE OF SIZE M FROM A
C       MIXTURE OF K MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN N DIMENSIONS.
C       THE SUBROUTINE PREDICTS THE DISTRIBUTION THAT EACH OBSERVATION
C       WAS SAMPLED FROM AND HENCE GROUPS THE OBSERVATIONS INTO K
C       CLUSTERS.  SEE PAGE 113 OF THE REFERENCE FOR A FURTHER
C       DESCRIPTION OF THE MIXTURE ALGORITHM.
C
C   2.  THE ROUTINE BEGINS WITH THE CLUSTER OF ALL OBJECTS AND THEN
C       DIVIDES INTO TWO, THEN THREE, ..., THEN FINALLY K CLUSTERS.
C       THE RESULTS ARE PRINTED AFTER EACH DIVISION ON FORTRAN UNIT
C       OUNIT.  THE RESULTS CONSIST OF THE WITHIN-CLUSTER VARIANCES FOR
C       EACH VARIABLE, THEN SETS UP A COLUMN FOR EACH CLUSTER.  THE
C       MIXTURE PROBABILITY IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A NEW OBJECT WILL
C       BE GROUPED INTO THAT CLUSTER.  THEN THE MEANS OF THE VARIABLES
C       FOR THE CLUSTER ARE PRINTED, AS WELL AS THE PROBABILITIES THAT
C       EACH CASE BELONGS TO EACH CLUSTER.
