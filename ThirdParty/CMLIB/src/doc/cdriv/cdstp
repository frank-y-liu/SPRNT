C  CDSTP performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C  problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
C  Communication with CDSTP is done with the following variables:
C
C    YH      An N by MAXORD+1 array containing the dependent variables
C              and their scaled derivatives.  MAXORD, the maximum order
C              used, is currently 12 for the Adams methods and 5 for the
C              Gear methods.  YH(I,J+1) contains the J-th derivative of
C              Y(I), scaled by H**J/factorial(J).  Only Y(I),
C              1 .LE. I .LE. N, need be set by the calling program on
C              the first entry.  The YH array should not be altered by
C              the calling program.  When referencing YH as a
C              2-dimensional array, use a column length of N, as this is
C              the value used in CDSTP.
C    DFDY    A block of locations used for partial derivatives if MITER
C              is not 0.  If MITER is 1 or 2 its length must be at least
C              N*N.  If MITER is 4 or 5 its length must be at least
C              (2*ML+MU+1)*N.
C    YWT     An array of N locations used in convergence and error tests
C    SAVE1
C    SAVE2   Arrays of length N used for temporary storage.
C    IPVT    An integer array of length N used by the linear system
C              solvers for the storage of row interchange information.
C    A       A block of locations used to store the matrix A, when using
C              the implicit method.  If IMPL is 1, A is a MATDIM by N
C              array.  If MITER is 1 or 2 MATDIM is N, and if MITER is 4
C              or 5 MATDIM is 2*ML+MU+1.  If IMPL is 2 its length is N.
C    JTASK   An integer used on input.
C              It has the following values and meanings:
C                 .EQ. 0  Perform the first step.  This value enables
C                         the subroutine to initialize itself.
C                .GT. 0  Take a new step continuing from the last.
C                         Assumes the last step was successful and
C                         user has not changed any parameters.
C                 .LT. 0  Take a new step with a new value of H and/or
C                         MINT and/or MITER.
C    JSTATE  A completion code with the following meanings:
C                1  The step was successful.
C                2  A solution could not be obtained with H .NE. 0.
C                3  A solution was not obtained in MXTRY attempts.
C                4  For IMPL .NE. 0, the matrix A is singular.
C              On a return with JSTATE .GT. 1, the values of T and
C              the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C              step, and H is the last step size attempted.
