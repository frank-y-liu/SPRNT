C***PURPOSE  CCHEX updates the Cholesky factorization  A=CTRANS(R)*R  of
C            a positive definite matrix A of order P under diagonal
C            permutations of the form U*R*E=RR, where E is a permutation
C            matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CCHEX updates the Cholesky factorization
C
C                   A = CTRANS(R)*R
C
C     of a positive definite matrix A of order P under diagonal
C     permutations of the form
C
C                   TRANS(E)*A*E
C
C     where E is a permutation matrix.  Specifically, given
C     an upper triangular matrix R and a permutation matrix
C     E (which is specified by K, L, and JOB), CCHEX determines
C     a unitary matrix U such that
C
C                           U*R*E = RR,
C
C     where RR is upper triangular.  At the users option, the
C     transformation U will be multiplied into the array Z.
C     If A = CTRANS(X)*X, so that R is the triangular part of the
C     QR factorization of X, then RR is the triangular part of the
C     QR factorization of X*E, i.e. X with its columns permuted.
C     For a less terse description of what CCHEX does and how
C     it may be applied, see the LINPACK Guide.
C
C     The matrix Q is determined as the product U(L-K)*...*U(1)
C     of plane rotations of the form
C
C                           (    C(I)       S(I) )
C                           (                    ) ,
C                           ( -CONJG(S(I))  C(I) )
C
C     where C(I) is real.  The rows these rotations operate on
C     are described below.
C
C     There are two types of permutations, which are determined
C     by the value of JOB.
C
C     1. Right circular shift (JOB = 1).
C
C         The columns are rearranged in the following order.
C
C                1,...,K-1,L,K,K+1,...,L-1,L+1,...,P.
C
C         U is the product of L-K rotations U(I), where U(I)
C         acts in the (L-I,L-I+1)-plane.
C
C     2. Left circular shift (JOB = 2).
C         The columns are rearranged in the following order
C
C                1,...,K-1,K+1,K+2,...,L,K,L+1,...,P.
C
C         U is the product of L-K rotations U(I), where U(I)
C         acts in the (K+I-1,K+I)-plane.
C
C     On Entry
C
C         R      COMPLEX(LDR,P), where LDR .GE. P.
C                R contains the upper triangular factor
C                that is to be updated.  Elements of R
C                below the diagonal are not referenced.
C
C         LDR    INTEGER.
C                LDR is the leading dimension of the array R.
C
C         P      INTEGER.
C                P is the order of the matrix R.
C
C         K      INTEGER.
C                K is the first column to be permuted.
C
C         L      INTEGER.
C                L is the last column to be permuted.
C                L must be strictly greater than K.
C
C         Z      COMPLEX(LDZ,NZ), where LDZ .GE. P.
C                Z is an array of NZ P-vectors into which the
C                transformation U is multiplied.  Z is
C                not referenced if NZ = 0.
C
C         LDZ    INTEGER.
C                LDZ is the leading dimension of the array Z.
C
C         NZ     INTEGER.
C                NZ is the number of columns of the matrix Z.
C
C         JOB    INTEGER.
C                JOB determines the type of permutation.
C                       JOB = 1  right circular shift.
C                       JOB = 2  left circular shift.
C
C     On Return
C
C         R      contains the updated factor.
C
C         Z      contains the updated matrix Z.
C
C         C      REAL(P).
C                C contains the cosines of the transforming rotations.
C
C         S      COMPLEX(P).
C                S contains the sines of the transforming rotations.
