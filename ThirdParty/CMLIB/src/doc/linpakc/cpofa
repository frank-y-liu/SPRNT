C***PURPOSE  Factors a COMPLEX HERMITIAN POSITIVE DEFINITE matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CPOFA factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix.
C
C     CPOFA is usually called by CPOCO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C     (Time for CPOCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(Time for CPOFA) .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       COMPLEX(LDA, N)
C                the Hermitian matrix to be factored.  Only the
C                diagonal and upper triangle are used.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix  R  so that  A =
C                CTRANS(R)*R where  CTRANS(R)  is the conjugate
C                transpose.  The strict lower triangle is unaltered.
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  signals an error condition.  The leading minor
C                     of order  K  is not positive definite.
