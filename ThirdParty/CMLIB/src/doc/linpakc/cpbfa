C***PURPOSE  Factors a COMPLEX HERMITIAN POSITIVE DEFINITE matrix (band
C            form)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CPBFA factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix
C     stored in band form.
C
C     CPBFA is usually called by CPBCO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABD     COMPLEX(LDA, N)
C                the matrix to be factored.  The columns of the upper
C                triangle are stored in the columns of ABD and the
C                diagonals of the upper triangle are stored in the
C                rows of ABD .  See the comments below for details.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
C                LDA must be .GE. M + 1 .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        M       INTEGER
C                the number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C                0 .LE. M .LT. N .
C
C     On Return
C
C        ABD     an upper triangular matrix  R , stored in band
C                form, so that  A = CTRANS(R)*R .
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  if the leading minor of order  K  is not
C                     positive definite.
C
C     Band Storage
C
C           If  A  is a Hermitian positive definite band matrix,
C           the following program segment will set up the input.
C
C                   M = (band width above diagonal)
C                   DO 20 J = 1, N
C                      I1 = MAX0(1, J-M)
C                      DO 10 I = I1, J
C                         K = I-J+M+1
C                         ABD(K,J) = A(I,J)
