C***PURPOSE  Solves the COMPLEX HERMITIAN POSITIVE DEFINITE BAND system
C            A*X=B using factors from CPBCO or CPBFA.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CPBSL solves the complex Hermitian positive definite band
C     system  A*X = B
C     using the factors computed by CPBCO or CPBFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABD     COMPLEX(LDA, N)
C                the output from CPBCO or CPBFA.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        M       INTEGER
C                the number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C
C        B       COMPLEX(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
C        a zero on the diagonal.  Technically this indicates
C        singularity but it is usually caused by improper subroutine
C        arguments.  It will not occur if the subroutines are called
C        correctly and  INFO .EQ. 0 .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL CPBCO(ABD,LDA,N,RCOND,Z,INFO)
C           IF (RCOND is too small .OR. INFO .NE. 0) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P
