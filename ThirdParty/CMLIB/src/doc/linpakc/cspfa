C***PURPOSE  Factors a COMPLEX SYMMETRIC matrix stored in packed form
C            by elimination with symmetric pivoting.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CSPFA factors a complex symmetric matrix stored in
C     packed form by elimination with symmetric pivoting.
C
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow CSPFA by CSPSL.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A)*C , follow CSPFA by CSPSL.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow CSPFA by CSPDI.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow CSPFA by CSPDI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the packed form of a symmetric matrix  A .  The
C                columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially
C                in a one-dimensional array of length  N*(N+1)/2 .
C                See comments below for details.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        AP      a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which
C                were used to obtain it stored in packed form.
C                The factorization can be written  A = U*D*TRANS(U)
C                where  U  is a product of permutation and unit
C                upper triangular matrices , TRANS(U) is the
C                transpose of  U , and  D  is block diagonal
C                with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks.
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  normal value.
C                = K  if the K-th pivot block is singular.  This is
C                     not an error condition for this subroutine,
C                     but it does indicate that CSPSL or CSPDI may
C                     divide by zero if called.

C     Packed Storage
C
C          The following program segment will pack the upper
C          triangle of a symmetric matrix.

C                K = 0
C                DO 20 J = 1, N
C                   DO 10 I = 1, J
C                      K = K + 1
C                      AP(K)  = A(I,J)
