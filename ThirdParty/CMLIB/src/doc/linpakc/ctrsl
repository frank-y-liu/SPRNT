C***AUTHOR  STEWART, G. W., (U. OF MARYLAND)
C***PURPOSE  Solves systems of the form  T*X=B  or CTRANS(T)*X=B  where
C            T is a triangular matrix. Here CTRANS(T) is conjugate
C            transpose.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CTRSL solves systems of the form
C
C                   T * X = B
C     or
C                   CTRANS(T) * X = B
C
C     where T is a triangular matrix of order N.  Here CTRANS(T)
C     denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix T.
C
C     On Entry
C
C         T         COMPLEX(LDT,N)
C                   T contains the matrix of the system.  The zero
C                   elements of the matrix are not referenced, and
C                   the corresponding elements of the array can be
C                   used to store other information.
C
C         LDT       INTEGER
C                   LDT is the leading dimension of the array T.
C
C         N         INTEGER
C                   N is the order of the system.
C
C         B         COMPLEX(N).
C                   B contains the right hand side of the system.
C
C         JOB       INTEGER
C                   JOB specifies what kind of system is to be solved.
C                   If JOB is
C
C                        00   solve T*X = B, T lower triangular,
C                        01   solve T*X = B, T upper triangular,
C                        10   solve CTRANS(T)*X = B, T lower triangular,
C                        11   solve CTRANS(T)*X = B, T upper triangular.
C
C     On Return
C
C         B         B contains the solution, if INFO .EQ. 0.
C                   Otherwise B is unaltered.
C
C         INFO      INTEGER
C                   INFO contains zero if the system is nonsingular.
C                   Otherwise INFO contains the index of
C                   the first zero diagonal element of T.
