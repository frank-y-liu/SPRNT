A collection of FORTRAN subprograms for simple linear regression
 
 
RGM...........computes estimates of simple linear regression  parameters
              for a geometric mean regression
RWILL.........estimates simple linear regression coefficients when  both
              variables are subject to errors which are not  necessarily
              homogeneous in variance (method due to Williamson)
RYORK.........estimates simple linear regression coefficients when  both
              variables are subject to errors which are not  necessarily
              homogeneous in variance (method due to York)
LINFS.........solves the model y = beta1 + (beta2)x  under the Chebyshev
              norm criterion
DLINFS........double precision version of LINFS
