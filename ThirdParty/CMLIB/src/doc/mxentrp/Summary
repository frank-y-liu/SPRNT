     BURG.....computes the coefficients of a finite length causal
              forward or backward prediction filter, and uses both the
              forward and backward predictions in a symmetric manner to
              generate the Maximum Entropy Spectrum by means of a
              Toeplitz  recursion.  (This program was copied from the
              book "Deconvolution of  Geophysical Time Series in the
              Exploration for Oil and  Natural Gas", by Manuel T. Silvia
              and Enders A. Robinson,  Elsevier Scientific Publishing
              Company, New York, 1979.)
