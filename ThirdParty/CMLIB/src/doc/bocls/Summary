 
     BOCLS is a package of Fortran subroutines for solving, in
double precision, bounded and constrained linear least squares
problems. That is, it finds a least squares solution to a system
of linear equations subject to general linear constraints and to
simple bounds on the variables.  The mathematical statement is
                 min ||Ex - f||
         subject to: Cx = y
                     l(i) <= x(i) <= b(i), i=1,...,n.
where
     ||.|| denotes the Euclidean norm (sum of squares)
     E     is an m by n matrix with m > n
     x     is an n-vector
     f     is an m-vector
     C     is a  k by n matrix with k < n
     y     is a k-vector.
The l(i) and the b(i) are lower and upper bounds respectively for the
corresponding x(i). They may be negative infinity or positive infinity
respectively indicating that there is no bound constraint.
     There are two user callable routines - DBOCLS for the general
problem and DBOLS for problems with only bounds.
