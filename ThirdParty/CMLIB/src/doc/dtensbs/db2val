C***PURPOSE  DB2VAL EVALUATES THE PIECEWISE POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATING
C            FUNCTION CONSTRUCTED BY THE ROUTINE DB2INK OR ONE OF ITS
C            PARTIAL DERIVATIVES.
C            DOUBLE PRECISION VERSION OF B2VAL.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   DB2VAL  evaluates   the   tensor   product   piecewise   polynomial
C   interpolant constructed  by  the  routine  DB2INK  or  one  of  its
C   derivatives at the point (XVAL,YVAL). To evaluate  the  interpolant
C   itself, set IDX=IDY=0, to evaluate the first partial  with  respect
C   to x, set IDX=1,IDY=0, and so on.
C
C   DB2VAL returns 0.0E0 if (XVAL,YVAL) is out of range. That is, if
C            XVAL.LT.TX(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.TX(NX+KX) .OR.
C            YVAL.LT.TY(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.TY(NY+KY)
C   If the knots TX  and  TY  were  chosen  by  DB2INK,  then  this  is
C   equivalent to
C            XVAL.LT.X(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.X(NX)+EPSX .OR.
C            YVAL.LT.Y(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.Y(NY)+EPSY
C   where EPSX = 0.1*(X(NX)-X(NX-1)) and EPSY = 0.1*(Y(NY)-Y(NY-1)).
C
C   The input quantities TX, TY, NX, NY, KX, KY, and  BCOEF  should  be
C   unchanged since the last call of DB2INK.
