C     This package solves systems of linear equations AX=B
C   with matrices A and B.  The system may be overdetermined
C   square and non singular or underdetermined.
C   Emphasis is put on detecting possible rank deficiency.
C   The package contains three user callable subroutines,
C     SGLSS  for the general problem, with "easy" call sequence
C     LLSIA  for the overdetermined system, flexible
C     ULSIA  for the underdetermined system, flexible.
