C***AUTHOR  MANTEUFFEL, T. A., (LANL)
C***PURPOSE  Solves the UNDERDETERMINED LINEAR system of equations
C            by performing an LQ factorization of the matrix A using
C            Householder transformations. Emphasis is put on detecting
C            possible rank deficiency.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     ULSIA computes the minimal length solution(s) to the problem AX=B
C     where A is an M by N matrix with M.LE.N and B is the M by NB
C     matrix of right hand sides.  User input bounds on the uncertainty
C     in the elements of A are used to detect numerical rank deficiency.
C     The algorithm employs a row and column pivot strategy to
C     minimize the growth of uncertainty and round-off errors.
C
C     ULSIA requires (MDA+1)*N + (MDB+1)*NB + 6*M dimensioned space

C     Input..
C
C     A(,)          Linear coefficient matrix of AX=B, with MDA the
C      MDA,M,N      actual first dimension of A in the calling program.
C                   M is the row dimension (no. of EQUATIONS of the
C                   problem) and N the col dimension (no. of UNKNOWNS).
C                   Must have MDA.GE.M and M.LE.N.
C
C     B(,)          Right hand side(s), with MDB the actual first
C      MDB,NB       dimension of B in the calling program. NB is the
C                   number of M by 1 right hand sides. Since the solutio
C                   is returned in B, must have MDB.GE.N. If NB = 0, B i
C                   never accessed.

C     RE(),AE(),KEY
C     RE()          RE() is a vector of length N such that RE(I) is
C                   the maximum relative uncertainty in row I of
C                   the matrix A. The values of RE() must be between
C                   0 and 1. A minimum of 10*machine precision will
C                   be enforced.
C
C     AE()          AE() is a vector of length N such that AE(I) is
C                   the maximum absolute uncertainty in row I of
C                   the matrix A. The values of AE() must be greater
C                   than or equal to 0.
C
C     KEY           For ease of use, RE and AE may be input as either
C                   vectors or scalars. If a scalar is input, the algo-
C                   rithm will use that value for each column of A.
C                   The parameter KEY indicates whether scalars or
C                   vectors are being input.
C                        KEY=0     RE scalar  AE scalar
C                        KEY=1     RE vector  AE scalar
C                        KEY=2     RE scalar  AE vector
C                        KEY=3     RE vector  AE vector
C
C
C     MODE          The integer MODE indicates how the routine
C                   is to react if rank deficiency is detected.
C                   If MODE = 0 return immediately, no solution
C                             1 compute truncated solution
C                             2 compute minimal length least squares sol
C                   The inexperienced user is advised to set MODE=0
C
C     NP            The first NP rows of A will not be interchanged
C                   with other rows even though the pivot strategy
C                   would suggest otherwise.
C                   The inexperienced user is advised to set NP=0.
C
C     WORK()        A real work array dimensioned 5*M. However,if
C                   RE or AE have been specified as vectors, dimension
C                   WORK 4*M. If both RE and AE have been specified
C                   as vectors, dimension WORK 3*M.

C     LW            Actual dimension of WORK

C
C     INFO          Is a flag which provides for the efficient
C                   solution of subsequent problems involving the
C                   same A but different B.
C                   If INFO = 0 original call
C                      INFO = 1 subsequent calls
C                   On subsequent calls, the user must supply A, KRANK,
C                   LW, IWORK, LIW, and the first 2*M locations of WORK
C                   as output by the original call to ULSIA. MODE must
C                   be equal to the value of MODE in the original call.
C                   If MODE.LT.2, only the first N locations of WORK
C                   are accessed. AE, RE, KEY, and NP are not accessed.

C     Output..
C
C     A(,)          Contains the lower triangular part of the reduced
C                   matrix and the transformation information. It togeth
C                   with the first M elements of WORK (see below)
C                   completely specify the LQ factorization of A.

C
C     KRANK,KSURE   The numerical rank of A,  based upon the relative
C                   and absolute bounds on uncertainty, is bounded
C                   above by KRANK and below by KSURE. The algorithm
C                   returns a solution based on KRANK. KSURE provides
C                   an indication of the precision of the rank.
C
C     RNORM()       Contains the Euclidean length of the NB residual
C                   vectors  B(I)-AX(I), I=1,NB. If the matrix A is of
C                   full rank, then RNORM=0.0.
C

C                   which the columns of A were used. The next
