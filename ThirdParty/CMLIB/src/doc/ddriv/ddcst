C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DDCST
C***REFER TO  DDRIV3
C  DDCST is called by DDNTL and sets coefficients used by the core
C  integrator DDSTP.  The array EL determines the basic method.
C  The array TQ is involved in adjusting the step size in relation
C  to truncation error.  EL and TQ depend upon MINT, and are calculated
C  for orders 1 to MAXORD(.LE. 12).  For each order NQ, the coefficients
C  EL are calculated from the generating polynomial:
C    L(T) = EL(1,NQ) + EL(2,NQ)*T + ... + EL(NQ+1,NQ)*T**NQ.
C  For the implicit Adams methods, L(T) is given by
C    dL/dT = (1+T)*(2+T)* ... *(NQ-1+T)/K,   L(-1) = 0,
C    where      K = factorial(NQ-1).
C  For the Gear methods,
C    L(T) = (1+T)*(2+T)* ... *(NQ+T)/K,
C    where      K = factorial(NQ)*(1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/NQ).
C  For each order NQ, there are three components of TQ.
