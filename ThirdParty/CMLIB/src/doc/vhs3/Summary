C
C     THIS PACKAGE CONSISTS OF FOUR USER-CALLABLE FORTRAN SUBROUTINES
C  FOR THE SOLUTION OF FINITE DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATIONS ON A STAGGERED
C  (CELL-CENTERED) GRID TO THREE-DIMENSIONAL HELMHOLTZ EQUATIONS.
C
C     THE USER-CALLABLE SUBROUTINES ARE:
C
C     1.  HS3CRI     INITIALIZATION ROUTINE FOR HS3CRT
C     2.  HS3CRT     GENERATES A FINITE DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION ON
C                    A STAGGERED GRID FOR THE HELMHOLTZ EQUATION IN
C                    THREE DIMENSIONS AND SOLVES IT BY CALLING PSTG3D
C     3.  PSTG3I     INITIALIZATION ROUTINE FOR PSTG3D
C     4.  PSTG3D     SOLVES CERTAIN BLOCK TRIDIAGONAL SYSTEMS OF LINEAR
C                    ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS ARISING FROM THE DISCRETIZATION
C                    OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL HELMHOLTZ EQUATION ON A
C                    STAGGERED GRID
