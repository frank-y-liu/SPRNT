C     Abstract     **** a double precision routine ****
C         DBSPDR is the BSPLDR routine of the reference.
C
C         DBSPDR uses the B-representation (T,A,N,K) to construct a
C         divided difference table ADIF preparatory to a (right)
C         derivative calculation in DBSPEV.  The lower triangular matrix
C         ADIF is stored in vector AD by columns.  The arrays are
C         related by
C
C           ADIF(I,J) = AD(I-J+1 + (2*N-J+2)*(J-1)/2)
C
C         I = J,N   ,   J=1,NDERIV.

C     Description of Arguments
C
C         Input      T,A are double precision
C          T       - knot vector of length N+K
C          A       - B-spline coefficient vector of length N
C          N       - number of B-spline coefficients
C                    N = sum of knot multiplicities-K
C          K       - order of the spline, K .GE. 1
C          NDERIV  - number of derivatives, 1 .LE. NDERIV .LE. K.
C                    NDERIV=1 gives the zero-th derivative =
C                    function value
C
C         Output     AD is double precision
C          AD      - table of differences in a vector of length
C                    (2*N-NDERIV+1)*NDERIV/2 for input to DBSPEV
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error
