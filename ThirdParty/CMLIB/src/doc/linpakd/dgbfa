C***PURPOSE  Factors a double precision BAND matrix by elimination.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DGBFA factors a double precision band matrix by elimination.
C
C     DGBFA is usually called by DGBCO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABD     DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                contains the matrix in band storage.  The columns
C                of the matrix are stored in the columns of  ABD  and
C                the diagonals of the matrix are stored in rows
C                ML+1 through 2*ML+MU+1 of  ABD .
C                See the comments below for details.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
C                LDA must be .GE. 2*ML + MU + 1 .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the original matrix.
C
C        ML      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
C                0 .LE. ML .LT.  N .
C
C        MU      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C                0 .LE. MU .LT.  N .
C                More efficient if  ML .LE. MU .
C     On Return
C
C        ABD     an upper triangular matrix in band storage and
C                the multipliers which were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = L*U  where
C                L  is a product of permutation and unit lower
C                triangular matrices and  U  is upper triangular.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  normal value.
C                = K  if  U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 .  This is not an error
C                     condition for this subroutine, but it does
C                     indicate that DGBSL will divide by zero if
C                     called.  Use  RCOND  in DGBCO for a reliable
C                     indication of singularity.
C
C     Band Storage
C
C           If  A  is a band matrix, the following program segment
C           will set up the input.
C
C                   ML = (band width below the diagonal)
C                   MU = (band width above the diagonal)
C                   M = ML + MU + 1
C                   DO 20 J = 1, N
C                      I1 = MAX0(1, J-MU)
C                      I2 = MIN0(N, J+ML)
C                      DO 10 I = I1, I2
C                         K = I - J + M
C                         ABD(K,J) = A(I,J)
C                10    CONTINUE
C                20 CONTINUE
C
C           This uses rows  ML+1  through  2*ML+MU+1  of  ABD .
C           In addition, the first  ML  rows in  ABD  are used for
C           elements generated during the triangularization.
C           The total number of rows needed in  ABD  is  2*ML+MU+1 .
C           The  ML+MU by ML+MU  upper left triangle and the
C           ML by ML  lower right triangle are not referenced.
