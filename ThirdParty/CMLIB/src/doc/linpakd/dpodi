C***PURPOSE  Computes the determinant and inverse of a certain double
C            precision SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE matrix (see abstract)
C            using the factors computed by DPOCO, DPOFA or DQRDC.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DPODI computes the determinant and inverse of a certain
C     double precision symmetric positive definite matrix (see below)
C     using the factors computed by DPOCO, DPOFA or DQRDC.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the output  A  from DPOCO or DPOFA
C                or the output  X  from DQRDC.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 11   both determinant and inverse.
C                = 01   inverse only.
C                = 10   determinant only.
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       If DPOCO or DPOFA was used to factor  A , then
C                DPODI produces the upper half of INVERSE(A) .
C                If DQRDC was used to decompose  X , then
C                DPODI produces the upper half of inverse(TRANS(X)*X)
C                where TRANS(X) is the transpose.
C                Elements of  A  below the diagonal are unchanged.
C                If the units digit of JOB is zero,  A  is unchanged.
C
C        DET     DOUBLE PRECISION(2)
C                determinant of  A  or of  TRANS(X)*X  if requested.
C                Otherwise not referenced.
C                Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C                with  1.0 .LE. DET(1) .LT. 10.0
C                or  DET(1) .EQ. 0.0 .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
C        a zero on the diagonal and the inverse is requested.
C        It will not occur if the subroutines are called correctly
C        and if DPOCO or DPOFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .
