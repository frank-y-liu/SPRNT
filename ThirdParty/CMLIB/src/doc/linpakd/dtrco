C***PURPOSE  Estimates the condition of a double precision TRIANGULAR
C            matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DTRCO estimates the condition of a double precision triangular
C     matrix.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        T       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDT,N)
C                T contains the triangular matrix.  The zero
C                elements of the matrix are not referenced, and
C                the corresponding elements of the array can be
C                used to store other information.
C
C        LDT     INTEGER
C                LDT is the leading dimension of the array T.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                N is the order of the system.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 0         T  is lower triangular.
C                = nonzero   T  is upper triangular.
C
C     On Return
C
C        RCOND   DOUBLE PRECISION
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  T .
C                For the system  T*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  T  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  T  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.
C
C        Z       DOUBLE PRECISION(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  T  is close to a singular matrix, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
