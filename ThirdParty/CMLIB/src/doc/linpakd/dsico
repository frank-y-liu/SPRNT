C***PURPOSE  Factors a d.p. SYMMETRIC matrix by elimination with symmet-
C            ric pivoting and estimates the condition of the matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DSICO factors a double precision symmetric matrix by elimination
C     with symmetric pivoting and estimates the condition of the
C     matrix.
C
C     If  RCOND  is not needed, DSIFA is slightly faster.
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow DSICO by DSISL.

C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow DSICO by DSIDI.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow DSICO by DSIDI.
C     To compute  INERTIA(A), follow DSICO by DSIDI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the symmetric matrix to be factored.
C                Only the diagonal and upper triangle are used.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     Output
C
C        A       a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which
C                were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = U*D*TRANS(U)
C                where  U  is a product of permutation and unit
C                upper triangular matrices, TRANS(U) is the
C                transpose of  U , and  D  is block diagonal
C                with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks.
C
C        KPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        RCOND   DOUBLE PRECISION
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  A .
C                For the system  A*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  A  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  A  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.
C
C        Z       DOUBLE PRECISION(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  A  is close to a singular matrix, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
