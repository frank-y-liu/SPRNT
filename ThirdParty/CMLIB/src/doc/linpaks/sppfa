C***PURPOSE  SPPFA factors a real SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE matrix
C            (packed form)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SPPFA factors a real symmetric positive definite matrix
C     stored in packed form.
C
C     SPPFA is usually called by SPPCO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C     (Time for SPPCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(Time for SPPFA) .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      REAL (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the packed form of a symmetric matrix  A .  The
C                columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially
C                in a one-dimensional array of length  N*(N+1)/2 .
C                See comments below for details.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        AP      an upper triangular matrix  R , stored in packed
C                form, so that  A = TRANS(R)*R .
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  if the leading minor of order  K  is not
C                     positive definite.

C     Packed Storage
C
C          The following program segment will pack the upper
C          triangle of a symmetric matrix.

C                K = 0
C                DO 20 J = 1, N
C                   DO 10 I = 1, J
C                      K = K + 1
C                      AP(K) = A(I,J)
