C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SGTSL given a general tridiagonal matrix and a right hand
C     side will find the solution.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                is the order of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        C       REAL(N)
C                is the subdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix.
C                C(2) through C(N) should contain the subdiagonal.
C                On output, C is destroyed.
C
C        D       REAL(N)
C                is the diagonal of the tridiagonal matrix.
C                On output, D is destroyed.
C
C        E       REAL(N)
C                is the superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix.
C                E(1) through E(N-1) should contain the superdiagonal.
C                On output, E is destroyed.
C
C        B       REAL(N)
C                is the right hand side vector.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       is the solution vector.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0 normal value.
C                = K if the K-th element of the diagonal becomes
C                    exactly zero.  The subroutine returns when
C                    this is detected.
