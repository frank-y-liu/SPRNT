C***PURPOSE  Factors a real SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE MATRIX
C            and estimates the condition number of the matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SPOCO factors a real symmetric positive definite matrix
C     and estimates the condition of the matrix.
C
C     If  RCOND  is not needed, SPOFA is slightly faster.
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow SPOCO by SPOSL.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A)*C , follow SPOCO by SPOSL.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow SPOCO by SPODI.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow SPOCO by SPODI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       REAL(LDA, N)
C                the symmetric matrix to be factored.  Only the
C                diagonal and upper triangle are used.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix  R  so that  A = TRANS(R)*R
C                where  TRANS(R)  is the transpose.
C                The strict lower triangle is unaltered.
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
C
C        RCOND   REAL
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  A .
C                For the system  A*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  A  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  A  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.  If INFO .NE. 0 , RCOND is unchanged.
C
C        Z       REAL(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  A  is close to a singular matrix, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , Z  is unchanged.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  signals an error condition.  The leading minor
C                     of order  K  is not positive definite.
