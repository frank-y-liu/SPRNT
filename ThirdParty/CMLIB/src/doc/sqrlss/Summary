C
C     This package is composed of two subroutines, SQRANK and SQRLSS
C  for the factorization and solving of a system of equations Ax=b,
C  where A is a rectangular matrix and x and b are vectors.  The
C  solution is in the least squares sense.  That is if A is longer
C  than wide not all the equations can be solved exactly and the
C  solution x will be that one which minimizes the sum of squares of the
C  residuals.  If A is wider than long then the solution is not unique
C  and the solution x will be the one with minimum length.
C  One advantage of these routines is that they use already existing
C  routines in the LINPACK package to do most of the linear algebra.
C  That is, they are mostly drivers for these other programs.
