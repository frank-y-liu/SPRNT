C***DATE WRITTEN   790601   (YYMMDD)
C***REVISION DATE  830401   (YYMMDD)
C***CATEGORY NO.  J1A1
C***KEYWORDS  FOURIER TRANSFORM
C***AUTHOR  SWARZTRAUBER, P. N., (NCAR)
C***PURPOSE  A Simplified real, periodic, backward transform
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine EZFFTB computes a real perodic sequence from its
C  Fourier coefficients (Fourier synthesis).  The transform is
C  defined below at Output Parameter R.  EZFFTB is a simplified
C  but slower version of RFFTB.
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  N       the length of the output array R.  The method is most
C          efficient when N is the product of small primes.
C
C  AZERO   the constant Fourier coefficient
C
C  A,B     arrays which contain the remaining Fourier coefficients.
C          These arrays are not destroyed.
C
C          The length of these arrays depends on whether N is even or
C          odd.
C
C          If N is even, N/2    locations are required.
C          If N is odd, (N-1)/2 locations are required
C
C  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15
C          in the program that calls EZFFTB.  The WSAVE array must be
C          initialized by calling subroutine EZFFTI(N,WSAVE), and a
C          different WSAVE array must be used for each different
C          value of N.  This initialization does not have to be
C          repeated so long as N remains unchanged.  Thus subsequent
C          transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
C          The same WSAVE array can be used by EZFFTF and EZFFTB.

C  Output Parameters
C
C  R       if N is even, define KMAX=N/2

C
C          For I=1,...,N
C
C          R(I) equals AZERO plus the sum from K=1 to K=KMAX of
C
C               ALPHA(K)*COS(K*(I-1)*2*PI/N+BETA(K))
C
C          where
