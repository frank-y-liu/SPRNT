C***PURPOSE  Forward sine transform with odd wave numbers.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine SINQF computes the fast Fourier transform of quarter
C  wave data.  That is, SINQF computes the coefficients in a sine
C  series representation with only odd wave numbers.  The transform
C  is defined below at output parameter X.
C
C  SINQB is the unnormalized inverse of SINQF since a call of SINQF
C  followed by a call of SINQB will multiply the input sequence X
C  by 4*N.
C
C  The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine SINQF must be
C  initialized by calling subroutine SINQI(N,WSAVE).
C
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  N       the length of the array X to be transformed.  The method
C          is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
C
C  X       an array which contains the sequence to be transformed
C
C  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15
C          in the program that calls SINQF.  The WSAVE array must be
C          initialized by calling subroutine SINQI(N,WSAVE), and a
C          different WSAVE array must be used for each different
C          value of N.  This initialization does not have to be
C          repeated so long as N remains unchanged.  Thus subsequent
C          transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
C
C  Output Parameters
C
C  X       For I=1,...,N
C
C               X(I) = (-1)**(I-1)*X(N)
C
C                  + the sum from K=1 to K=N-1 of
C
C                  2*X(K)*SIN((2*I-1)*K*PI/(2*N))
C
C               A call of SINQF followed by a call of
C               SINQB will multiply the sequence X by 4*N.
C               Therefore SINQB is the unnormalized inverse
C               of SINQF.
C
C  WSAVE   contains initialization calculations which must not
C          be destroyed between calls of SINQF or SINQB.
