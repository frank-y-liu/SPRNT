C***CATEGORY NO.  J1A1
C***KEYWORDS  FOURIER TRANSFORM
C***AUTHOR  SWARZTRAUBER, P. N., (NCAR)
C***PURPOSE  Initialize EZFFTF and EZFFTB
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine EZFFTI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in
C  both EZFFTF and EZFFTB.  The prime factorization of N together with
C  a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
C  stored in WSAVE.
C
C  Input Parameter
C
C  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.
C
C  Output Parameter
C
C  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15.
C          The same work array can be used for both EZFFTF and EZFFTB
C          as long as N remains unchanged.  Different WSAVE arrays
C          are required for different values of N.
