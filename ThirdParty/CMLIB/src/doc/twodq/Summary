c
c     A set of routines for the evaluation of a definite integral over
c  one or more triangles in the plane.
c     This program assumes that the integrand is available as a Fortran
c  Function.  The user describes the domain of integration by giving the
c  vertices of the triangles and inputs an error tolerance, which may
c  be absolute or relative.  He/she also has a choice of two quadrature
c  routines which are used in the "guts" of TWODQ. One is particularly
c  suitable for functions which have singularities on the boundary of
c  the domain.
c     The basic algorithm is "global adaption".
