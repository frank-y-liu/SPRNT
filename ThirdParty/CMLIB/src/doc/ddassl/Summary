C***DESCRIPTION
C  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  this code solves a system of differential/
C  algebraic equations of the form
C  g(t,y,yprime) = 0.
C
C  subroutine ddassl uses the backward
C  differentiation formulas of orders one
C  through five to solve a system of the above
C  form for y and yprime. values for y
C  and yprime at the initial time must
C  be given as input. these values must
C  be consistent, (that is. if t,y,yprime
C  are the given initial values, they must
C  satisfy g(t,y,yprime) = 0.)
C  the subroutine solves the system from t to tout. it is
C  easy to continue the solution to get results
C  at additional tout. this is the interval
C  mode of operation. intermediate results can
C  also be obtained easily by using the intermediate-
C  output capability.
