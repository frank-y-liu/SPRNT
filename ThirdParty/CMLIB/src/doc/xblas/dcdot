C***PURPOSE  Computes the dot product of 2 complex vectors, CX and CY,
C            e.g. CX DOT CY, or, CXconjugate DOT CY. The real and imagin
C            parts of CX and CY are converted to double precision, the
C            dot product accumulation is done in double precision and
C            the output is given as 2 double precision numbers,
C            corresponding to the real and imaginary part of the result.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Computes the dot product of 2 complex vectors, CX and CY, e.g.
C    CX DOT CY, or, CXconjugate DOT CY.  The real and imaginary
C    parts of CX and CY are converted to double precision, the dot
C    product accumulation is done in double precision and the output
C    is given as 2 double precision numbers, corresponding to the real
C    and imaginary part of the result.
C     Input
C      N:  Number of complex components of CX and CY.
C      FM: =+1.0   compute CX DOT CY.
C          =-1.0   compute CXconjugate DOT CY.
C      CX(N):
C      CY(N):  Complex arrays of length N.
C      INCX:(Integer)   Spacing of elements of CX to use
C      INCY:(Integer)   Spacing of elements of CY to use.
C     Output
C      DCR:(Double Precision) Real part of dot product.
C      DCI:(Double Precision) Imaginary part of dot product.
