C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine VSINQB computes the backward fast Fourier sine transform
C  of M quarter wave sequences.  That is, sine series representations
C  with only odd wave numbers.  The transform is defined below at output
C  parameter X.
C
C  The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine VSINQB must be
C  initialized by calling subroutine VSINQI(N,WSAVE).
C
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  M       the number of sequences to be transformed.
C
C  N       the length of the sequences to be transformed.  The method
C          is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
C
C  X       an array of size at least X(MDIMX,N) which contains the
C          the sequences to be transformed.  The sequences are stored
C          in the ROWS of X.  Thus, the Jth sequence is stored in
C          X(J,I), I=1,..,N.
C
C  XT      a work array of size at least XT(MDIMX,N).
C
C  MDIMX   the first dimension of the array X exactly as it appears in
C          the calling program.
C
C  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*N+15
C          in the program that calls VSINQB.  The WSAVE array must be
C          initialized by calling subroutine VSINQI(N,WSAVE), and a
C          different WSAVE array must be used for each different
C          value of N.  This initialization does not have to be
C          repeated so long as N remains unchanged.
C
C  Output Parameters
C
C  X       for I=1,...,N and J=1,...,M
C
C               X(I)= the sum from K=1 to K=N of
C
C                 4*X(K)*SIN((2k-1)*I*PI/(2*N)) /SQRT(4*N)
C
C
C  WSAVE   contains initialization calculations which must not
C          be destroyed between calls of VSINQB or VSINQF.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  NOTE  -  A call of VSINQF followed immediately by a call of
C           of VSINQB will return the original sequences X.  Thus,
C           VSINQB is the correctly normalized inverse VSINQF.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  VSINQB is a straightforward extension of the subprogram SINQB to
C  handle M simultaneous sequences.  SINQB was orginally developed
C  by P. N. Swarztrauber of NCAR.
