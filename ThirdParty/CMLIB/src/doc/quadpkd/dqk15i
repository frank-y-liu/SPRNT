C***PURPOSE  The original (infinite integration range is mapped
C            onto the interval (0,1) and (A,B) is a part of (0,1).
C            it is the purpose to compute
C            I = Integral of transformed integrand over (A,B),
C            J = Integral of ABS(Transformed Integrand) over (A,B).
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C           Integration Rule
C           Standard Fortran subroutine
C           Double precision version
C
C           PARAMETERS
C            ON ENTRY
C              F      - Double precision
C                       Fuction subprogram defining the integrand
C                       FUNCTION F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                       Declared E X T E R N A L in the calling program.
C
C              BOUN   - Double precision
C                       Finite bound of original integration
C                       Range (SET TO ZERO IF INF = +2)
C
C              INF    - Integer
C                       If INF = -1, the original interval is
C                                   (-INFINITY,BOUND),
C                       If INF = +1, the original interval is
C                                   (BOUND,+INFINITY),
C                       If INF = +2, the original interval is
C                                   (-INFINITY,+INFINITY) AND
C                       The integral is computed as the sum of two
C                       integrals, one over (-INFINITY,0) and one over
C                       (0,+INFINITY).
C
C              A      - Double precision
C                       Lower limit for integration over subrange
C                       of (0,1)
C
C              B      - Double precision
C                       Upper limit for integration over subrange

C
C            ON RETURN
C              RESULT - Double precision
C                       Approximation to the integral I
C                       Result is computed by applying the 15-POINT
C                       KRONROD RULE(RESK) obtained by optimal addition
C                       of abscissae to the 7-POINT GAUSS RULE(RESG).
C
C              ABSERR - Double precision
C                       Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                       WHICH SHOULD EQUAL or EXCEED ABS(I-RESULT)
C

C                       Approximation to the integral J
C
C              RESASC - Double precision
C                       Approximation to the integral of
C                       ABS((TRANSFORMED INTEGRAND)-I/(B-A)) over (A,B)
