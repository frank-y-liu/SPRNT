C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Integration over infinite intervals
C Standard fortran subroutine
C
C            F      - Double precision
C                     Function subprogram defining the integrand
C                     function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                     declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program.
C
C            BOUND  - Double precision
C                     Finite bound of integration range
C                     (has no meaning if interval is doubly-infinite)
C
C            INF    - Integer
C                     Indicating the kind of integration range involved
C                     INF = 1 corresponds to  (BOUND,+INFINITY),
C                     INF = -1            to  (-INFINITY,BOUND),
C                     INF = 2             to (-INFINITY,+INFINITY).
C
C            EPSABS - Double precision
C                     Absolute accuracy requested
C            EPSREL - Double precision
C                     Relative accuracy requested
C                     If  EPSABS.LE.0
C                     and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28),
C                     the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C            LIMIT  - Integer
C                     Gives an upper bound on the number of subintervals
C                     in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1
C
C         ON RETURN
C            RESULT - Double precision
C                     Approximation to the integral
C
C            ABSERR - Double precision
C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C            NEVAL  - Integer
C                     Number of integrand evaluations
C
C            IER    - Integer
C                     IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the
C                             routine. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has been achieved.
C                   - IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine. The
C                             estimates for result and error are less
C                             reliable. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However,if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties.
C                             If the position of a local difficulty can
C                             be determined (e.g. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one
C                             will probably gain from splitting up the
C                             interval at this point and calling the
C                             integrator on the subranges. If possible,
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             should be used, which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 4 The algorithm does not converge.
C                             Roundoff error is detected in the
C                             extrapolation table.
C                             It is assumed that the requested tolerance
C                             cannot be achieved, and that the returned
C                             result is the best which can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. It must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid, because
