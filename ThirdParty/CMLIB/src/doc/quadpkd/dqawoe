C                     function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                     declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program.

C
C            B      - Double precision
C                     Upper limit of integration
C
C            OMEGA  - Double precision
C                     Parameter in the integrand weight function
C
C            INTEGR - Integer
C                     Indicates which of the WEIGHT functions is to be
C                     used
C                     INTEGR = 1      W(X) = COS(OMEGA*X)
C                     INTEGR = 2      W(X) = SIN(OMEGA*X)
C                     If INTEGR.NE.1 and INTEGR.NE.2, the routine
C                     will end with IER = 6.
C
C            EPSABS - Double precision
C                     Absolute accuracy requested
C            EPSREL - Double precision
C                     Relative accuracy requested
C                     If  EPSABS.LE.0
C                     and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28),
C                     the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C            LIMIT  - Integer
C                     Gives an upper bound on the number of subdivisions
C                     in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1.
C
C            ICALL  - Integer
C                     If DQAWOE is to be used only once, ICALL must
C                     be set to 1.  Assume that during this call, the
C                     Chebyshev moments (for CLENSHAW-CURTIS integration
C                     of degree 24) have been computed for intervals of
C                     lenghts (ABS(B-A))*2**(-L), L=0,1,2,...MOMCOM-1.
C                     If ICALL.GT.1 this means that DQAWOE has been
C                     called twice or more on intervals of the same
C                     length ABS(B-A). The Chebyshev moments already
C                     computed are then re-used in subsequent calls.
C                     If ICALL.LT.1, the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C            MAXP1  - Integer
C                     Gives an upper bound on the number of Chebyshev
C                     moments which can be stored, i.e. for the
C                     intervals of lenghts ABS(B-A)*2**(-L),
C                     L=0,1, ..., MAXP1-2, MAXP1.GE.1.
C                     If MAXP1.LT.1, the routine will end with IER = 6.

C                     Approximation to the integral
C

C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C            NEVAL  - Integer
C                     Number of integrand evaluations
C
C            IER    - Integer
C                     IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the
C                             routine. It is assumed that the
C                             requested accuracy has been achieved.
C                   - IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine.
C                             The estimates for integral and error are
C                             less reliable. It is assumed that the
C                             requested accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT (and taking according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand, in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties.
C                             If the position of a local difficulty can
C                             be determined (e.g. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one
C                             will probably gain from splitting up the
C                             interval at this point and calling the
C                             integrator on the subranges. If possible,
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             should be used which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 4 The algorithm does not converge.
C                             Roundoff error is detected in the
C                             extrapolation table.
C                             It is presumed that the requested
C                             tolerance cannot be achieved due to
C                             roundoff in the extrapolation table,
C                             and that the returned result is the
C                             best which can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. It must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.GT.0.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid, because
