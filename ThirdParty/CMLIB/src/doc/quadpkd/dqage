C                     Gives an upperbound on the number of subintervals
C                     in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1.
C
C         ON RETURN
C            RESULT - Double precision
C                     Approximation to the integral
C
C            ABSERR - Double precision
C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C

C
C            IER    - Integer

C                             accuracy has been achieved.
C                     IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine
C                             The estimates for result and error are
C                             less reliable. It is assumed that the
C                             requested accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value
C                             of LIMIT.
C                             However, if this yields no improvement it
C                             is rather advised to analyze the integrand
C                             in order to determine the integration
C                             difficulties. If the position of a local
C                             difficulty can be determined(e.g.
C                             SINGULARITY, DISCONTINUITY within the
C                             interval) one will probably gain from
C                             splitting up the interval at this point
C                             and calling the integrator on the
C                             subranges. If possible, an appropriate
C                             special-purpose integrator should be used
C                             which is designed for handling the type of
C                             difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
