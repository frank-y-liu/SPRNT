  QUADPKD is a package of Fortran programs for computing definite
  integrals of various forms.  These programs are the double
  precision analogues of programs in the QUADPKS package. Please
  refer to documentation of QUADPKS for an overview of its
  capabilities.
 
  The double precision subprogram names are the same as their
  single precision counterparts except that they are preceded by
  a "D".  Thus the single precision program QAG is DQAG in
  double precision.
