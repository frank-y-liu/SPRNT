C                     And EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28),
C                     The routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C         ON RETURN
C            RESULT - Double precision
C                     Approximation to the integral
C
C            ABSERR - Double precision
C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)

C
C            IER    - Integer
C                     IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the
C                             routine. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has been achieved.
C                     IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine
C                             The estimates for integral and error are
C                             less reliable. It is assumed that the
C                             requested accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more sub-
C                             divisions by increasing the value of LIMIT
C                             (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account. However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties. If
C                             the position of a local difficulty can be
C                             determined (E.G. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY WITHIN THE INTERVAL) one
C                             will probably gain from splitting up the
C                             interval at this point and calling the
C                             integrator on the subranges. If possible,
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             should be used, which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is detec-
C                             ted, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour
C                             occurs at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 4 The algorithm does not converge.
C                             Roundoff error is detected in the
C                             Extrapolation table. It is presumed that
C                             the requested tolerance cannot be
C                             achieved, and that the returned result is
C                             the best which can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. It must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid, because
C                             (EPSABS.LE.0 AND
C                              EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28)

C                             WORK(LIMIT*3+1) are set to zero, WORK(1)

C                    with IER = 6.

C                    such that WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(1)),... ,
C                    WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(K)) form a decreasing
C                    sequence, with K = LAST IF LAST.LE.(LIMIT/2+2),
C                    and K = LIMIT+1-LAST otherwise
