C***PURPOSE  SCOV calculates the covariance matrix for a nonlinear
C            data fitting problem.  It is intended to be used after
C            a successful return from either SNLS1 or SNLS1E.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  1. Purpose.
C
C     SCOV calculates the covariance matrix for a nonlinear data
C     fitting problem.  It is intended to be used after a
C     successful return from either SNLS1 or SNLS1E. SCOV
C     and SNLS1 (and SNLS1E) have compatible parameters.  The
C     required external subroutine, FCN, is the same
C     for all three codes, SCOV, SNLS1, and SNLS1E.
C
C  2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
C
C     SUBROUTINE SCOV(FCN,IOPT,M,N,X,FVEC,R,LDR,INFO,
C                     WA1,WA2,WA3,WA4)
C     INTEGER IOPT,M,N,LDR,INFO
C     REAL X(N),FVEC(M),R(LDR,N),WA1(N),WA2(N),WA3(N),WA4(M)
C     EXTERNAL FCN
C
C  3. Parameters.
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the functions.  If the user wants to supply the Jacobian
C         (IOPT=2 or 3), then FCN must be written to calculate the
C         Jacobian, as well as the functions.  See the explanation
C         of the IOPT argument below.
C         If the user wants the iterates printed in SNLS1 or SNLS1E,
C         then, FCN must do the printing.  See the explanation of NPRINT
C         in SNLS1 or SNLS1E.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL
C         statement in the calling program and should be written as
C         follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(IFLAG,M,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC)
C         INTEGER IFLAG,LDFJAC,M,N
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(M)
C         ----------
C         FJAC and LDFJAC may be ignored     , if IOPT=1.
C         REAL FJAC(LDFJAC,N)                , if IOPT=2.
C         REAL FJAC(N)                       , if IOPT=3.
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=0, the values in X and FVEC are available
C           for printing in SNLS1 or SNLS1E.
C           IFLAG will never be zero when FCN is called by SCOV.
C           The values of X and FVEC must not be changed.
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=1, calculate the functions at X and return
C           this vector in FVEC.
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=2, calculate the full Jacobian at X and return
C           this matrix in FJAC.  Note that IFLAG will never be 2 unless
C           IOPT=2.  FVEC contains the function values at X and must
C           not be altered.  FJAC(I,J) must be set to the derivative
C           of FVEC(I) with respect to X(J).
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=3, calculate the LDFJAC-th row of the Jacobian
C           and return this vector in FJAC.  Note that IFLAG will
C           never be 3 unless IOPT=3.  FJAC(J) must be set to
C           the derivative of FVEC(LDFJAC) with respect to X(J).
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C         END
C
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SCOV.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C
C       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
C         be calculated.  If IOPT=2 or 3, then the user must supply the
C         Jacobian, as well as the function values, through the
C         subroutine FCN.  If IOPT=2, the user supplies the full
C         Jacobian with one call to FCN.  If IOPT=3, the user supplies
C         one row of the Jacobian with each call.  (In this manner,
C         storage can be saved because the full Jacobian is not stored.)
C         If IOPT=1, the code will approximate the Jacobian by forward
C         differencing.
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         functions.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         variables.  N must not exceed M.
C
C       X is an array of length N.  On input X must contain the value
C         at which the covariance matrix is to be evaluated.  This is
C         usually the value for X returned from a successful run of
C         SNLS1 (or SNLS1E).  The value of X will not be changed.
C
C    FVEC is an output array of length M which contains the functions
C         evaluated at X.
C
C       R is an output array.  For IOPT=1 and 2, R is an M by N array.
C         For IOPT=3, R is an N by N array.  On output, if INFO=1,
C         the upper N by N submatrix of R contains the covariance
C         matrix evaluated at X.
C
C     LDR is a positive integer input variable which specifies
C         the leading dimension of the array R.  For IOPT=1 and 2,
C         LDR must not be less than M.  For IOPT=3, LDR must not
C         be less than N.
C
C    INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
C         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
C         description of FCN. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
C
C         INFO = 0 Improper input parameters (M.LE.0 or N.LE.0).
C
C         INFO = 1 Successful return.  The covariance matrix has been
C                  calculated and stored in the upper N by N
C                  submatrix of R.
C
C         INFO = 2 The Jacobian matrix is singular for the input value
C                  of X.  The covariance matrix cannot be calculated.
C                  The upper N by N submatrix of R contains the QR
C                  factorization of the Jacobian (probably not of
C                  interest to the user).
C
C WA1,WA2 are work arrays of length N.
C and WA3
C
C     WA4 is a work array of length M.
