C***PURPOSE  Computes a sequence of exponentially scaled modified Bessel
C            functions of the third kind of fractional order.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C BESKES computes a sequence of exponentially scaled
C (i.e., multipled by EXP(X)) modified Bessel
C functions of the third kind of order XNU + I at X, where X .GT. 0,
C XNU lies in (-1,1), and I = 0, 1, ... , NIN - 1, if NIN is positive
C and I = 0, -1, ... , NIN + 1, if NIN is negative.  On return, the
C vector BKE(.) contains the results at X for order starting at XNU.
