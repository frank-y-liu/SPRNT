C***PURPOSE  Computes a d.p. sequence of modified Bessel functions of
C            the third kind of fractional order.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C DBESKS computes a sequence of modified Bessel functions of the third
C kind of order XNU + I at X, where X .GT. 0, XNU lies in (-1,1),
C and I = 0, 1, ... , NIN - 1, if NIN is positive and I = 0, 1, ... ,
C NIN + 1, if NIN is negative.  On return, the vector BK(.) contains
C the results at X for order starting at XNU.  XNU, X, and BK are
C double precision.  NIN is an integer.
