C***AUTHOR  FULLERTON, W., (LANL)
C***PURPOSE  Computes the complementary incomplete Gamma function.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Evaluate the complementary incomplete gamma function
C
C GAMIC = integral from T = X to infinity of EXP(-T) * T**(A-1.)  .
C
C GAMIC is evaluated for arbitrary real values of A and for non-negative
C values of X (even though GAMIC is defined for X .LT. 0.0), except that
C for X = 0 and A .LE. 0.0, GAMIC is undefined.  GAMIC, A, and X
C are single precision.
C
C      A slight deterioration of 2 or 3 digits accuracy will occur when
C GAMIC is very large or very small in absolute value, because log-
C arithmic variables are used.  Also, if the parameter A is very close
C to a negative integer (but not a negative integer), there is a loss
C of accuracy, which is reported if the result is less than half
C machine precision.
