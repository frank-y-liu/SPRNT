C***PURPOSE  Computes Tricomi's form of the incomplete Gamma function.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Evaluate Tricomi's incomplete gamma function defined by
C
C GAMIT = X**(-A)/GAMMA(A) * integral T = 0 to X of EXP(-T) * T**(A-1.)
C
C for A .GT. 0.0 and by analytic
C continuation for A .LE. 0.0.  GAMMA(X) is the complete
C gamma function of X.  GAMIT is evaluated for arbitrary real values of
C A and for non-negative values of X (even though GAMIT is defined for
C X .LT. 0.0), except that for X = 0 and A .LE. 0.0, GAMIT is infinite,
C a fatal error.
C
C      A slight deterioration of 2 or 3 digits accuracy will occur when
C GAMIT is very large or very small in absolute value, because log-
C arithmic variables are used.  Also, if the parameter A is very close
C to a negative integer (but not a negative integer), there is a loss
C of accuracy, which is reported if the result is less than half
C machine precision.
