C                 RV  Random Variables
C
C      RV is a package of random number generators.
C
C         UNI generates uniform numbers on [0,1).
C        RNOR generates normal numbers with zero mean and
C                 standard deviation one.
C
C      The major advantages of these generators are long cycle,
C      very high degree of portability and reproducibility of
C      results on different machines.
C
C      In addition, as of May 1983, RNOR is the fastest of all
C      the Fortran normal random number generators we have tested.
