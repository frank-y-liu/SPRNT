C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     These subroutines solve the least squares problem Ax = b for
C     banded matrices A using sequential accumulation of rows of the
C     data matrix.  Exactly one right-hand side vector is permitted.
C
C     These subroutines are intended for the type of least squares
C     systems that arise in applications such as curve or surface
C     fitting of data.  The least squares equations are accumulated and
C     processed using only part of the data.  This requires a certain
C     user interaction during the solution of Ax = b.
C
C     Specifically, suppose the data matrix (A B) is row partitioned
C     into Q submatrices.  Let (E F) be the T-th one of these
C     submatrices where E = (0 C 0).  Here the dimension of E is MT by N
C     and the dimension of C is MT by NB.  The value of NB is the
C     bandwidth of A.  The dimensions of the leading block of zeros in E
C     are MT by JT-1.
C
C     The user of the subroutine BNDACC provides MT,JT,C and F for
C     T=1,...,Q.  Not all of this data must be supplied at once.
C
C     Following the processing of the various blocks (E F), the matrix
C     (A B) has been transformed to the form (R D) where R is upper
C     triangular and banded with bandwidth NB.  The least squares
C     system Rx = d is then easily solved using back substitution by
C     executing the statement CALL BNDSOL(1,...). The sequence of
C     values for JT must be nondecreasing.  This may require some
C     preliminary interchanges of rows and columns of the matrix A.
C
C     The primary reason for these subroutines is that the total
C     processing can take place in a working array of dimension MU by
C     NB+1.  An acceptable value for MU is
C
C                       MU = MAX(MT + N + 1),
C
C     where N is the number of unknowns.
C
C     Here the maximum is taken over all values of MT for T=1,...,Q.
C     Notice that MT can be taken to be a small as one, showing that
C     MU can be as small as N+2.  The subprogram BNDACC processes the
C     rows more efficiently if MU is large enough so that each new
C     block (C F) has a distinct value of JT.
C
C     The four principle parts of these algorithms are obtained by the
C     following call statements
C
C     CALL BNDACC(...)  Introduce new blocks of data.
C
C     CALL BNDSOL(1,...)Compute solution vector and length of
C                       residual vector.
C
C     CALL BNDSOL(2,...)Given any row vector H solve YR = H for the
C                       row vector Y.
C
C     CALL BNDSOL(3,...)Given any column vector W solve RZ = W for
C                       the column vector Z.

C     The dots in the above call statements indicate additional
C     arguments that will be specified in the following paragraphs.
