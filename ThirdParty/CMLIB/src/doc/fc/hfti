C***PURPOSE  Solve the least squares problem Ax = b for
C            banded matrices A using sequential accumulation of rows of
C            the data matrix. Exactly one right-handed side vector is
C            permitted.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DIMENSION A(MDA,N),(B(MDB,NB) or B(M)),RNORM(NB),H(N),G(N),IP(N)
C
C     This subroutine solves a linear least squares problem or a set of
C     linear least squares problems having the same matrix but different
C     right-side vectors.  The problem data consists of an M by N matrix
C     A, an M by NB matrix B, and an absolute tolerance parameter TAU
C     whose usage is described below.  The NB column vectors of B
C     represent right-side vectors for NB distinct linear least squares
C     problems.
C
C     This set of problems can also be written as the matrix least
C     squares problem
C
C                       AX = B,
C
C     where X is the N by NB solution matrix.
C
C     Note that if B is the M by M identity matrix, then X will be the
C     pseudo-inverse of A.
C
C     This subroutine first transforms the augmented matrix (A B) to a
C     matrix (R C) using premultiplying Householder transformations with
C     column interchanges.  All subdiagonal elements in the matrix R are
C     zero and its diagonal elements satisfy
C
C                       ABS(R(I,I)).GE.ABS(R(I+1,I+1)),
C
C                       I = 1,...,L-1, where
C
C                       L = MIN(M,N).
C
C     The subroutine will compute an integer, KRANK, equal to the number
C     of diagonal terms of R that exceed TAU in magnitude. Then a
C     solution of minimum Euclidean length is computed using the first
C     KRANK rows of (R C).
C
C     To be specific we suggest that the user consider an easily
C     computable matrix norm, such as, the maximum of all column sums of
C     magnitudes.
C
C     Now if the relative uncertainty of B is EPS, (norm of uncertainty/
C     norm of B), it is suggested that TAU be set approximately equal to
C     EPS*(norm of A).
C
C     The user must dimension all arrays appearing in the call list..
C     A(MDA,N),(B(MDB,NB) or B(M)),RNORM(NB),H(N),G(N),IP(N).  This
C     permits the solution of a range of problems in the same array
C     space.
C
C     The entire set of parameters for HFTI are
C
C     INPUT..
C
C     A(*,*),MDA,M,N    The array A(*,*) initially contains the M by N
C                       matrix A of the least squares problem AX = B.
C                       The first dimensioning parameter of the array
C                       A(*,*) is MDA, which must satisfy MDA.GE.M
C                       Either M.GE.N or M.LT.N is permitted.  There
C                       is no restriction on the rank of A.  The
C                       condition MDA.LT.M is considered an error.
C
C     B(*),MDB,NB       If NB = 0 the subroutine will perform the
C                       orthogonal decomposition but will make no
C                       references to the array B(*).  If NB.GT.0
C                       the array B(*) must initially contain the M by
C                       NB matrix B of the least squares problem AX =
C                       B.  If NB.GE.2 the array B(*) must be doubly
C                       subscripted with first dimensioning parameter
C                       MDB.GE.MAX(M,N).  If NB = 1 the array B(*) may
C                       be either doubly or singly subscripted.  In
C                       the latter case the value of MDB is arbitrary
C                       but it should be set to some valid integer
C                       value such as MDB = M.
C
C                       The condition of NB.GT.1.AND.MDB.LT. MAX(M,N)
C                       is considered an error.
C
C     TAU               Absolute tolerance parameter provided by user
C                       for pseudorank determination.
C
C     H(*),G(*),IP(*)   Arrays of working space used by HFTI.
C
C     OUTPUT..
C
C     A(*,*)            The contents of the array A(*,*) will be
C                       modified by the subroutine. These contents
C                       are not generally required by the user.
C
C     B(*)              On return the array B(*) will contain the N by
C                       NB solution matrix X.
C
C     KRANK             Set by the subroutine to indicate the
C                       pseudorank of A.
C
C     RNORM(*)          On return, RNORM(J) will contain the Euclidean
C                       norm of the residual vector for the problem
C                       defined by the J-th column vector of the array
C                       B(*,*) for J = 1,...,NB.
C
C     H(*),G(*)         On return these arrays respectively contain
C                       elements of the pre- and post-multiplying
C                       Householder transformations used to compute
C                       the minimum Euclidean length solution.
C
C     IP(*)             Array in which the subroutine records indices
C                       describing the permutation of column vectors.
C                       The contents of arrays H(*),G(*) and IP(*)
C                       are not generally required by the user.
