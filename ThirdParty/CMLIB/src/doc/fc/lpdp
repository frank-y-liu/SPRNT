C
C     DIMENSION A(MDA,N+1),PRGOPT(*),X(N),WS((M+2)*(N+7)),IS(M+N+1),
C     where N=N1+N2.  This is a slight overestimate for WS(*).
C
C     Written by R. J. Hanson and K. H. Haskell, Sandia Labs
C     Revised Oct. 1, 1981.
C
C     Determine an N1-vector W, and
C               an N2-vector Z
C     which minimizes the Euclidean length of W
C     subject to G*W+H*Z .GE. Y.
C     This is the least projected distance problem, LPDP.
C     The matrices G and H are of respective
C     dimensions M by N1 and M by N2.
C
C     Called by subprogram LSI( ).
C
C     The matrix
C                (G H Y)
C
C     occupies rows 1,...,M and cols 1,...,N1+N2+1 of A(*,*).
C
C     The solution (W) is returned in X(*).
C                  (Z)
C
C     The value of MODE indicates the status of
C     the computation after returning to the user.
C
C          MODE=1  The solution was successfully obtained.
C
C          MODE=2  The inequalities are inconsistent.
