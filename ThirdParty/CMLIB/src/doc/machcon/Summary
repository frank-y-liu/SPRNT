 
MACHCON IS A SET OF THREE FORTRAN FUNCTIONS THAT PROVIDE MACHINE
DEPENDENT INFORMATION.
 
     THE FORM OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE
        R = R1MACH(K)
        I = I1MACH(K)
        D = D1MACH(K)
WHERE
        R    IS A REAL (SINGLE PRECISION) NUMBER
        I    IS AN INTEGER
        D    IS A DOUBLE PRECISION NUMBER
AND
        K    IS AN INTEGER
 
BY USING THESE FUNCTIONS IN YOUR FORTRAN PROGRAMS, LARGE NUMBERS OF
PROGRAMS CAN BE MOVED FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER BY SIMPLY CHANGING
THESE THREE FUNCTIONS.
