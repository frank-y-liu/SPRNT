C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        XGETUA may be called to determine the unit number or numbers
C        to which error messages are being sent.
C        These unit numbers may have been set by a call to XSETUN,
C        or a call to XSETUA, or may be a default value.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Output--
C        IUNIT - an array of one to five unit numbers, depending
C                on the value of N.  A value of zero refers to the
C                default unit, as defined by the I1MACH machine
C                constant routine.  Only IUNIT(1),...,IUNIT(N) are
C                defined by XGETUA.  The values of IUNIT(N+1),...,
C                IUNIT(5) are not defined (for N .LT. 5) or altered
C                in any way by XGETUA.
C        N     - the number of units to which copies of the
C                error messages are being sent.  N will be in the
C                range from 1 to 5.
