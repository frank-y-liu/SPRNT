C***DATE WRITTEN   800319   (YYMMDD)
C***REVISION DATE  840405   (YYMMDD)
C***CATEGORY NO.  R3C
C***KEYWORDS  ERROR,XERROR PACKAGE
C***AUTHOR  JONES, R. E., (SNLA)
C***PURPOSE  Processes error message allowing 2 integer and two real
C            values to be included in the message.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        XERRWV processes a diagnostic message, in a manner
C        determined by the value of LEVEL and the current value
C        of the library error control flag, KONTRL.
C        (See subroutine XSETF for details.)
C        In addition, up to two integer values and two real
C        values may be printed along with the message.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Input--
C        MESSG - the Hollerith message to be processed.
C        NMESSG- the actual number of characters in MESSG.
C        NERR  - the error number associated with this message.
C                NERR must not be zero.
C        LEVEL - error category.
C                =2 means this is an unconditionally fatal error.
C                =1 means this is a recoverable error.  (I.e., it is
C                   non-fatal if XSETF has been appropriately called.)
C                =0 means this is a warning message only.
C                =-1 means this is a warning message which is to be
C                   printed at most once, regardless of how many
C                   times this call is executed.
C        NI    - number of integer values to be printed. (0 to 2)
C        I1    - first integer value.
C        I2    - second integer value.
C        NR    - number of real values to be printed. (0 to 2)
C        R1    - first real value.
C        R2    - second real value.

C     Examples
C        CALL XERROR(29HSMOOTH -- NUM (=I1) WAS ZERO.,29,1,2,
C    1   1,NUM,0,0,0.,0.)
C        CALL XERRWV(54HQUADXY -- REQUESTED ERROR (R1) LESS THAN MINIMUM
C    1 (R2).,54,77,1,0,0,0,2,ERRREQ,ERRMIN)
