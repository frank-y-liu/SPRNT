C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of
C     the ALGOL procedure ORTBAK, NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968)
C     by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     upper Hessenberg matrix determined by  CORTH.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix.
C
C        AR and AI contain information about the unitary
C          transformations used in the reduction by  CORTH
C          in their strict lower triangles.
C
C        ORTR and ORTI contain further information about the
C          transformations used in the reduction by  CORTH.
C          Only elements LOW through IGH are used.
C
C        M is the number of columns of ZR and ZI to be back transformed.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the eigenvectors to be
C          back transformed in their first M columns.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors
C          in their first M columns.
C
C        ORTR and ORTI have been altered.
C
C     Note that CORTB preserves vector Euclidean norms.
