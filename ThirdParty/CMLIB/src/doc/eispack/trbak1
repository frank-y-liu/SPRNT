C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRBAK1,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL SYMMETRIC
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by  TRED1.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  TRED1
C          in its strict lower triangle.
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is arbitrary.
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C
C        Z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
C          in its first M columns.
C
C     On Output
C
C        Z contains the transformed eigenvectors
C          in its first M columns.
C
C     Note that TRBAK1 preserves vector Euclidean norms.
