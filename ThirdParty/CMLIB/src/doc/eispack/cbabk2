C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure
C     CBABK2, which is a complex version of BALBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) by Parlett and Reinsch.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 315-326(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     balanced matrix determined by  CBAL.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by  CBAL.
C
C        SCALE contains information determining the permutations
C          and scaling factors used by  CBAL.
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the eigenvectors to be
C          back transformed in their first M columns.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors
C          in their first M columns.
