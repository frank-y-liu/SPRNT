C***PURPOSE  Computes eigenvalues of a complex upper Hessenberg m
C            using the modified LR method.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure COMLR,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 369-376(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 396-403(1971).
C
C     This subroutine finds the eigenvalues of a COMPLEX
C     UPPER Hessenberg matrix by the modified LR method.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1, IGH=N.
C
C        HR and HI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the complex upper Hessenberg matrix.
C          Their lower triangles below the subdiagonal contain the
C          multipliers which were used in the reduction by  COMHES,
C          if performed.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        The upper Hessenberg portions of HR and HI have been
C          destroyed.  Therefore, they must be saved before
C          calling  COMLR  if subsequent calculation of
C          eigenvectors is to be performed.
C
C        WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the eigenvalues.  If an error
C          exit is made, the eigenvalues should be correct
C          for indices IERR+1,...,N.
C
C        IERR is set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after a total of 30*N iterations.
C
C     Calls CSROOT for complex square root.
C     Calls CDIV for complex division.
