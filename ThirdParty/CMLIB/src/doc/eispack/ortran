C***PURPOSE  Accumulates orthogonal similarity transformations in
C            reduction of real general matrix by ORTHES.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTRANS,
C     NUM. MATH. 16, 181-204(1970) by Peters and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 372-395(1971).
C
C     This subroutine accumulates the orthogonal similarity
C     transformations used in the reduction of a REAL GENERAL
C     matrix to upper Hessenberg form by  ORTHES.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1, IGH=N.
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  ORTHES
C          in its strict lower triangle.
C
C        ORT contains further information about the trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  ORTHES.
C          only elements LOW through IGH are USED.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        Z contains the transformation matrix produced in the
C          reduction by  ORTHES.
C
C        ORT has been altered.
