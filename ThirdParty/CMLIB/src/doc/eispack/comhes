C***PURPOSE  Reduces complex general matrix to complex upper Hess
C            form using stabilized elementary similarity
C            transformations.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure COMHES,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     Given a COMPLEX GENERAL matrix, this subroutine
C     reduces a submatrix situated in rows and columns
C     LOW through IGH to upper Hessenberg form by
C     stabilized elementary similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH ARE integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1, IGH=N.
C
C        AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the complex input matrix.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the Hessenberg matrix.  The
C          multipliers which were used in the reduction
C          are stored in the remaining triangles under the
C          Hessenberg matrix.
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns
C          interchanged in the reduction.
C          Only elements LOW through IGH are used.
C
C     Calls CDIV for complex division.
