C***PURPOSE  Transforms certain real non-symmetric tridiagonal matrix
C            to symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Given a NONSYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix such that the products
C     of corresponding pairs of off-diagonal elements are all
C     non-negative, and zero only when both factors are zero, this
C     subroutine reduces it to a SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix
C     using and accumulating diagonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        T contains the input matrix.  Its subdiagonal is
C          stored in the last N-1 positions of the first column,
C          its diagonal in the N positions of the second column,
C          and its superdiagonal in the first N-1 positions of
C          the third column.  T(1,1) and T(N,3) are arbitrary.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        T is unaltered.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric matrix.
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is not set.
C
C        Z contains the transformation matrix produced in
C          the reduction.
C
C        IERR is set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          N+I        if T(I,1)*T(I-1,3) is negative,
C          2*N+I      if T(I,1)*T(I-1,3) is zero with
C                     one factor non-zero.
