C            from HTRIDI.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of
C     the ALGOL procedure TRBAK1, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968)
C     by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.

C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX HERMITIAN
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     real symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by  HTRIDI.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        AR and AI contain information about the unitary trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  HTRIDI  in their
C          full lower triangles except for the diagonal of AR.
C
C        TAU contains further information about the transformations.
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C
C        ZR contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
C          in its first M columns.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors
C          in their first M columns.
C
C     Note that the last component of each returned vector
C     is real and that vector Euclidean norms are preserved.
