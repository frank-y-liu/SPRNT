C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure REBAKB,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 99-110(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 303-314(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a generalized
C     SYMMETRIC eigensystem by back transforming those of the
C     derived symmetric matrix determined by  REDUC2.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix system.
C
C        B contains information about the similarity transformation
C          (cholesky decomposition) used in the reduction by  REDUC2
C          in its strict lower triangle.
C
C        DL contains further information about the transformation.
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C
C        Z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
C          in its first M columns.
C
C     On Output
C
C        Z contains the transformed eigenvectors
C          in its first M columns.
