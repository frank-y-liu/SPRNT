C            tridiagonal matrix using unitary similarity
C            transformations.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of
C     the ALGOL procedure TRED1, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968)
C     by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.

C
C     This subroutine reduces a COMPLEX HERMITIAN matrix
C     to a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix using
C     unitary similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the complex hermitian input matrix.
C          Only the lower triangle of the matrix need be supplied.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        AR and AI contain information about the unitary trans-
C          formations used in the reduction in their full lower
C          triangles.  Their strict upper triangles and the
C          diagonal of AR are unaltered.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is set to zero.
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E.
C          E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed.
C
C        TAU contains further information about the transformations.
C
C     Calls PYTHAG(A,B) for sqrt(A**2 + B**2).
