C***PURPOSE  Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex upper
C            Hessenberg matrix using modified LR method.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure COMLR2,
C     NUM. MATH. 16, 181-204(1970) by Peters and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 372-395(1971).
C
C     This subroutine finds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
C     of a COMPLEX UPPER Hessenberg matrix by the modified LR
C     method.  The eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL matrix
C     can also be found if  COMHES  has been used to reduce
C     this general matrix to Hessenberg form.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1, IGH=N.
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns interchanged
C          in the reduction by  COMHES, if performed.  Only elements
C          LOW through IGH are used.  If the eigenvectors of the HESSEN-
C          BERG matrix are desired, set INT(J)=J for these elements.
C
C        HR and HI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the complex upper Hessenberg matrix.
C          Their lower triangles below the subdiagonal contain the
C          multipliers which were used in the reduction by  COMHES,
C          if performed.  If the eigenvectors of the Hessenberg
C          matrix are desired, these elements must be set to zero.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        The upper Hessenberg portions of HR and HI have been
C          destroyed, but the location HR(1,1) contains the norm
C          of the triangularized matrix.
C
C        WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the eigenvalues.  If an error
C          exit is made, the eigenvalues should be correct
C          for indices IERR+1,...,N.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors
C          are unnormalized.  If an error exit is made, none of
C          the eigenvectors has been found.
C
C        IERR is set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after a total of 30*N iterations.
C
C     Calls CSROOT for complex square root.
C     Calls CDIV for complex division.
