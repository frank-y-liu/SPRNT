C***PURPOSE  Reduce real symmetric matrix to symmetric tridiagonal
C            matrix using orthogonal similarity transformations.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRED1,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971).
C
C     This subroutine reduces a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix
C     to a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using
C     orthogonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        A contains the real symmetric input matrix.  Only the
C          lower triangle of the matrix need be supplied.
C
C     On Output
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction in its strict lower
C          triangle.  The full upper triangle of A is unaltered.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is set to zero.
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E.
C          E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed.
