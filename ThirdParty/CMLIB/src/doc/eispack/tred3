C***PURPOSE  Reduce real symmetric matrix stored in packed form to
C            symmetric tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal
C            transformations.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRED3,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971).
C
C     This subroutine reduces a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix, stored as
C     a one-dimensional array, to a symmetric tridiagonal matrix
C     using orthogonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On Input
C
C        n is the order of the matrix.
C
C        NV must be set to the dimension of the array parameter A
C          as declared in the calling program dimension statement.
C
C        A contains the lower triangle of the real symmetric
C          input matrix, stored row-wise as a one-dimensional
C          array, in its first N*(N+1)/2 positions.
C
C     On Output
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal
C          transformations used in the reduction.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is set to zero.
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E.
C          E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed.
