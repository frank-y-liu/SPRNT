C            eigenvectors of upper Hesenberg matrix output from ORTHES
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     upper Hessenberg matrix determined by  ORTHES.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix.
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  ORTHES
C          in its strict lower triangle.
C
C        ORT contains further information about the trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  ORTHES.
C          Only elements LOW through IGH are used.
C
C        M is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed.
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigen-
C          vectors to be back transformed in its first M columns.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the
C          transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns.
C
C        ORT has been altered.
C
C     NOTE that ORTBAK preserves vector Euclidean norms.
