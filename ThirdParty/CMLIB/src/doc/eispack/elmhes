C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ELMHES,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     Given a REAL GENERAL matrix, this subroutine
C     reduces a submatrix situated in rows and columns
C     LOW through IGH to upper Hessenberg form by
C     stabilized elementary similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
C          array parameters as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are integers determined by the balancing
C          subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1, IGH=N.
C
C        A contains the input matrix.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        A contains the Hessenberg matrix.  The multipliers
C          which were used in the reduction are stored in the
C          remaining triangle under the Hessenberg matrix.
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns
C          interchanged in the reduction.
C          Only elements LOW through IGH are used.
