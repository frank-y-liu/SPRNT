C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  CNBSL
C***DATE WRITTEN   800730   (YYMMDD)
C***REVISION DATE  820801   (YYMMDD)
C***CATEGORY NO.  D2C2
C***KEYWORDS  BAND,COMPLEX,LINEAR EQUATIONS,NONSYMMETRIC
C***AUTHOR  VOORHEES, E., (LANL)
C***PURPOSE  Solves a COMPLEX BAND system using factors computed by
C            CNBCO or CNBFA.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CNBSL solves the complex band system
C     A * X = B  or  CTRANS(A) * X = B
C     using the factors computed by CNBCO or CNBFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABE     COMPLEX(LDA, NC)
C                the output from CNBCO or CNBFA.
C                NC must be .GE. 2*ML+MU+1 .
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABE .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the original matrix.
C
C        ML      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
C
C        MU      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CNBCO or CNBFA.
C
C        B       COMPLEX(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 0         to solve  A*X = B .
C                = nonzero   to solve  CTRANS(A)*X = B , where
C                            CTRANS(A)  is the conjugate transpose.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains a
C        zero on the diagonal.  Technically this indicates singularity
C        but it is often caused by improper arguments or improper
C        setting of LDA.  It will not occur if the subroutines are
C        called correctly and if CNBCO has set RCOND .GT. 0.0
C        or CNBFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL CNBCO(ABE,LDA,N,ML,MU,IPVT,RCOND,Z)
C           IF (RCOND is too small) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P
C             CALL CNBSL(ABE,LDA,N,ML,MU,IPVT,C(1,J),0)
