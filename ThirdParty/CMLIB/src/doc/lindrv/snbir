C***PURPOSE  SNBIR solves a GENERAL NONSYMMETRIC BANDED
C            NXN system of linear equations.  Iterative
C            refinement is used to obtain an error estimate.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C    Subroutine SNBIR solves a general nonsymmetric banded NxN
C    system of single precision real linear equations using
C    SLATEC subroutines SNBFA and SNBSL.  These are adaptations
C    of the LINPACK subroutines SGBFA and SGBSL, which require
C    a different format for storing the matrix elements.
C    One pass of iterative refinement is used only to obtain an
C    estimate of the accuracy.  If  A  is an NxN real banded
C    matrix and if  X  and  B  are real N-vectors, then SNBIR
C    solves the equation
C
C                          A*X=B.
C
C    A band matrix is a matrix whose nonzero elements are all
C    fairly near the main diagonal, specifically  A(I,J) = 0
C    if  I-J is greater than  ML  or  J-I  is greater than
C    MU .  The integers ML and MU are called the lower and upper
C    band widths and  M = ML+MU+1  is the total band width.
C    SNBIR uses less time and storage than the corresponding
C    program for general matrices (SGEIR) if 2*ML+MU .LT. N .
C
C    The matrix A is first factored into upper and lower tri-
C    angular matrices U and L using partial pivoting.  These
C    factors and the pivoting information are used to find the
C    solution vector X .  Then the residual vector is found and used
C    to calculate an estimate of the relative error, IND .  IND esti-
C    mates the accuracy of the solution only when the input matrix
C    and the right hand side are represented exactly in the computer
C    and does not take into account any errors in the input data.
C
C    If the equation A*X=B is to be solved for more than one vector
C    B, the factoring of A does not need to be performed again and
C    the option to only solve (ITASK .GT. 1) will be faster for
C    the succeeding solutions.  In this case, the contents of A, LDA,
C    N, work and IWORK must not have been altered by the user follow-
C    ing factorization (ITASK=1).  IND will not be changed by SNBIR
C    in this case.
C
C
C    Band Storage
C
C          If  A  is a band matrix, the following program segment
C          will set up the input.
C
C                  ML = (band width below the diagonal)
C                  MU = (band width above the diagonal)
C                  DO 20 I = 1, N
C                     J1 = MAX0(1, I-ML)
C                     J2 = MIN0(N, I+MU)
C                     DO 10 J = J1, J2
C                        K = J - I + ML + 1
C                        ABE(I,K) = A(I,J)
C               10    CONTINUE
C               20 CONTINUE
C
C          This uses columns  1  Through  ML+MU+1  of ABE .
C
C    Example:  If the original matrix is
C
C          11 12 13  0  0  0
C          21 22 23 24  0  0
C           0 32 33 34 35  0
C           0  0 43 44 45 46
C           0  0  0 54 55 56
C           0  0  0  0 65 66
C
C     then  N = 6, ML = 1, MU = 2, LDA .GE. 5  and ABE should contain
C
C           * 11 12 13        , * = not used
C          21 22 23 24
C          32 33 34 35
C          43 44 45 46
C          54 55 56  *
C          65 66  *  *

C  Argument Description ***
C
C    ABE    REAL(LDA,MM)
C             on entry, contains the matrix in band storage as
C               described above.  MM  must not be less than  M =
C               ML+MU+1 .  The user is cautioned to dimension  ABE
C               with care since MM is not an argument and cannot
C               be checked by SNBIR.  The rows of the original
C               matrix are stored in the rows of  ABE  and the
C               diagonals of the original matrix are stored in
C               columns  1  through  ML+MU+1  of  ABE .  ABE  is
C               not altered by the program.
C    LDA    INTEGER
C             the leading dimension of array ABE.  LDA must be great-
C             er than or equal to N.  (terminal error message IND=-1)
C    N      INTEGER
C             the order of the matrix A.  N must be greater
C             than or equal to 1 .  (terminal error message IND=-2)
C    ML     INTEGER
C             the number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
C             ML  must not be less than zero nor greater than or
C             equal to  N .  (terminal error message IND=-5)
C    MU     INTEGER
C             the number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C             MU  must not be less than zero nor greater than or
C             equal to  N .  (terminal error message IND=-6)
C    V      REAL(N)
C             on entry, the singly subscripted array(vector) of di-
C               mension N which contains the right hand side B of a
C               system of simultaneous linear equations A*X=B.
C             on return, V contains the solution vector, X .
C    ITASK  INTEGER
C             If ITASK=1, the matrix A is factored and then the
C               linear equation is solved.
C             If ITASK .GT. 1, the equation is solved using the existing
C               factored matrix A and IWORK.
C             If ITASK .LT. 1, then terminal error message IND=-3 is
C               printed.
C    IND    INTEGER
C             GT. 0  IND is a rough estimate of the number of digits
C                     of accuracy in the solution, X .  IND=75 means
C                     that the solution vector  X  is zero.
C             LT. 0  See error message corresponding to IND below.
C    WORK   REAL(N*(NC+1))
C             a singly subscripted array of dimension at least
C             N*(NC+1)  where  NC = 2*ML+MU+1 .
C    IWORK  INTEGER(N)
C             a singly subscripted array of dimension at least N.
