   DEPAC is a suite of FORTRAN programs for the solution of initial
value problems for ordinary differential equations,
 
                 y' = f(x,y)
                             y(x-init) = y-init
 
Currently, there are three user callable programs in this package,
 
                 DERKF           Runge Kutta method
                 DEABM           Adams predictor corrector method
                 DEBDF           Gear stiff method
 
One major advantage of the DEPAC organiziation is that all three programs
have almost identical calling sequences.  This facilitates changing from
one to the other.
