C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     HSTCSP solves the standard five-point finite difference
C     approximation on a staggered grid to the modified Helmholtz
C     equation spherical coordinates assuming axisymmetry (no dependence
C     on longitude).
C
C                  (1/R**2)(d/dR)(R**2(dU/dR)) +
C
C       1/(R**2*SIN(THETA))(d/dTHETA)(SIN(THETA)(dU/dTHETA)) +
C
C            (LAMBDA/(R*SIN(THETA))**2)U  =  F(THETA,R)
C
C     where THETA is colatitude and R is the radial coordinate.
C     This two-dimensional modified Helmholtz equation results from
C     the Fourier transform of the three-dimensional Poisson equation.

C
C   INTL
C     = 0  On initial entry to HSTCSP or if any of the arguments
C          C, D, N, or NBDCND are changed from a previous call.
C
C     = 1  If C, D, N, and NBDCND are all unchanged from previous
C          call to HSTCSP.
C
C     NOTE:  A call with INTL = 0 takes approximately 1.5 times as much
C            time as a call with INTL = 1.  Once a call with INTL = 0
C            has been made then subsequent solutions corresponding to
C            different F, BDA, BDB, BDC, and BDD can be obtained
C            faster with INTL = 1 since initialization is not repeated.
C
C   A,B
C     The range of THETA (colatitude), i.e. A .LE. THETA .LE. B.  A
C     must be less than B and A must be non-negative.  A and B are in
C     radians.  A = 0 corresponds to the north pole and B = PI
C     corresponds to the south pole.
C
C                  * * *  IMPORTANT  * * *
C
C     If B is equal to PI, then B must be computed using the statement
C
C     B = PIMACH(DUM)
C
C     This insures that B in the user's program is equal to PI in this
C     program which permits several tests of the input parameters that
C     otherwise would not be possible.
C
C                  * * * * * * * * * * * *
C
C   M
C     The number of grid points in the interval (A,B).  The grid points
C     in the THETA-direction are given by THETA(I) = A + (I-0.5)DTHETA
C     for I=1,2,...,M where DTHETA =(B-A)/M.  M must be greater than 4.
C
C   MBDCND
C     Indicates the type of boundary conditions at THETA = A and
C     THETA = B.
C
C     = 1  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and THETA = B.
C          (See notes 1, 2 below)
C
C     = 2  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and the derivative
C          of the solution with respect to THETA is specified at
C          THETA = B (See notes 1, 2 below).
C
C     = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C          specified at THETA = A (See notes 1, 2 below) and THETA = B.
C
C     = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C          specified at THETA = A (See notes 1, 2 below) and the
C          solution is specified at THETA = B.
C
C     = 5  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and the
C          solution is specified at THETA = B. (See note 2 below)
C
C     = 6  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and the
C          derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C          specified at THETA = B (See note 2 below).
C
C     = 7  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and the
C          solution is unspecified at THETA = B = PI.
C
C     = 8  If the derivative of the solution with respect to
C          THETA is specified at THETA = A (See note 1 below)
C          and the solution is unspecified at THETA = B = PI.
C
C     = 9  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and
C          THETA = B = PI.
C
C     NOTES:  1.  If A = 0, do not use MBDCND = 1,2,3,4,7 or 8,
C                 but instead use MBDCND = 5, 6, or 9.
C
C             2.  if B = PI, do not use MBDCND = 1,2,3,4,5 or 6,
C                 but instead use MBDCND = 7, 8, or 9.
C
C             When A = 0  and/or B = PI the only meaningful boundary
C             condition is dU/dTHETA = 0.  (See D. Greenspan, 'Numerical
C             Analysis of Elliptic Boundary Value Problems,' Harper and
C             Row, 1965, Chapter 5.)
C
C   BDA
C     A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
C     values (if any) of the solution at THETA = A.  When
C     MBDCND = 1, 2, or 7,
C
C              BDA(J) = U(A,R(J)) ,              J=1,2,...,N.
C
C     When MBDCND = 3, 4, or 8,
C
C              BDA(J) = (d/dTHETA)U(A,R(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
C
C     When MBDCND has any other value, BDA is a dummy variable.
C
C   BDB
C     A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
C     values of the solution at THETA = B.  When MBDCND = 1, 4, or 5,
C
C              BDB(J) = U(B,R(J)) ,              J=1,2,...,N.
C
C     When MBDCND = 2,3, or 6,
C
C              BDB(J) = (d/dTHETA)U(B,R(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
C
C     When MBDCND has any other value, BDB is a dummy variable.
C
C   C,D
C     The range of R , i.e. C .LE. R .LE. D.
C     C must be less than D.  C must be non-negative.
C
C   N
C     The number of unknowns in the interval (C,D).  The unknowns in
C     the R-direction are given by R(J) = C + (J-0.5)DR,
C     J=1,2,...,N, where DR = (D-C)/N.  N must be greater than 4.
C
C   NBDCND
C     Indicates the type of boundary conditions at R = C
C     and R = D.
C
C     = 1  If the solution is specified at R = C and R = D.
C
C     = 2  If the solution is specified at R = C and the derivative
C          of the solution with respect to R is specified at
C          R = D. (See note 1 below)
C
C     = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C          specified at R = C and R = D.
C
C     = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C          specified at R = C and the solution is specified at
C          R = D.
C
C     = 5  If the solution is unspecified at R = C = 0 (See note 2
C          below) and the solution is specified at R = D.
C
C     = 6  If the solution is unspecified at R = C = 0 (See note 2
C          below) and the derivative of the solution with respect to R
C          is specified at R = D.
C
C     NOTE 1:  If C = 0 and MBDCND = 3,6,8 or 9, the system of equations
C              to be solved is singular.  The unique solution is
C              determined by extrapolation to the specification of
C              U(THETA(1),C).  But in these cases the right side of the
C              system will be perturbed by the constant PERTRB.
C
C     NOTE 2:  NBDCND = 5 or 6 cannot be used with MBDCND = 1, 2, 4, 5,
C              or 7 (the former indicates that the solution is
C              unspecified at R = 0; the latter indicates that the
C              solution is specified).  Use instead NBDCND = 1 or 2.
C
C   BDC
C     A one dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
C     values of the solution at R = C.   When NBDCND = 1 or 2,
C
C              BDC(I) = U(THETA(I),C) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
C
C     When NBDCND = 3 or 4,
C
C              BDC(I) = (d/dR)U(THETA(I),C),         I=1,2,...,M.
C
C     When NBDCND has any other value, BDC is a dummy variable.
C
C   BDD
C     A one-dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
C     values of the solution at R = D.  When NBDCND = 1 or 4,
C
C              BDD(I) = U(THETA(I),D) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
C
C     When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
C
C              BDD(I) = (d/dR)U(THETA(I),D) ,        I=1,2,...,M.
C
C     When NBDCND has any other value, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C   ELMBDA
C     The constant LAMBDA in the modified Helmholtz equation.  If
C     LAMBDA is greater than 0, a solution may not exist.  However,
C     HSTCSP will attempt to find a solution.
C
C   F
C     A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C     side of the modified Helmholtz equation.  For I=1,2,...,M and
C     J=1,2,...,N
C
C              F(I,J) = F(THETA(I),R(J)) .
C
C     F must be dimensioned at least M X N.
C
C   IDIMF
C     The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C     program calling HSTCSP.  This parameter is used to specify the
C     variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M.
C
C   W
C     A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C     work space.  With K = INT(log2(N))+1 and L = 2**(K+1), W may
C     require up to (K-2)*L+K+MAX(2N,6M)+4(N+M)+5 locations.  The
C     actual number of locations used is computed by HSTCSP and is
C     returned in the location W(1).
C
C
C            * * * * * *   On Output   * * * * * *
C
C   F
C     Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C     approximation for the grid point (THETA(I),R(J)) for
C     I=1,2,...,M, J=1,2,...,N.
C
C   PERTRB
C     If a combination of periodic, derivative, or unspecified
C     boundary conditions is specified for a Poisson equation
C     (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a con-
C     stant, calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures
C     that a solution exists.  HSTCSP then computes this
C     solution, which is a least squares solution to the
C     original approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also
C     a solution; hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of
C     PERTRB should be small compared to the right side F.
C     Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an essentially different
C     problem.  This comparison should always be made to insure that
C     a meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C   IERROR
C     An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.
C     Except for numbers 0 and 10, a solution is not attempted.

C     the call.

C    Algorithm      This subroutine defines the finite-difference
C                   equations, incorporates boundary data, adjusts the
C                   right side when the system is singular and calls
C                   BLKTRI which solves the linear system of equations.
