C     MDIMF
C        The column (or second) dimension of the array F and the row (or

C
C     F
C        Contains the solution U(I,J,K) of the finite difference
C        approximation for the grid point (X(I),Y(J),Z(K)) for
C        I=1,2,...,L+1, J=1,2,...,M+1, and K=1,2,...,N+1.
C
C     PERTRB
C        If a combination of periodic or derivative boundary conditions
C        is specified for a Poisson equation (LAMBDA = 0), a solution
C        may not exist.  PERTRB is a constant, calculated and subtracted
C        from F, which ensures that a solution exists.  pwscrt then
C        computes this solution, which is a least squares solution to
C        the original approximation.  This solution is not unique and is
C        unnormalized.  The value of PERTRB should be small compared to
C        the right side F.  Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an
C        essentially different problem.  This comparison should always
C        be made to insure that a meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C     IERROR
C        An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C        for numbers 0 and 12, a solution is not attempted.
C
C        =  0  No error

C
C        Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly incorrect
C        call to HW3CRT, the user should test IERROR after the call.

C
C     Algorithm      This subroutine defines the finite difference
C                    equations, incorporates boundary data, and
C                    adjusts the right side of singular systems and
C                    then calls POIS3D to solve the system.

C     Timing and        The execution time T on the NCAR Control Data
C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HW3CRT is roughly proportional
C                    to L*M*N*(log2(L)+log2(M)+5), but also depends on
C                    input parameters LBDCND and MBDCND.  Some typical
C                    values are listed in the table below.
C                       The solution process employed results in a loss
C                    of no more than three significant digits for L,M
C                    and N as large as 32.  More detailed information
C                    about accuracy can be found in the documentation
C                    for subroutine POIS3D which is the routine that
C                    actually solves the finite difference equations.
