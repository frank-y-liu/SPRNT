C***PURPOSE  Solves a complex block tridiagonal linear system of
C            equations by a cyclic reduction algorithm .
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutine CMGNBN solves the complex linear system of equations
C
C          A(I)*X(I-1,J) + B(I)*X(I,J) + C(I)*X(I+1,J)
C
C          + X(I,J-1) - 2.*X(I,J) + X(I,J+1) = Y(I,J)
C
C               For I = 1,2,...,M  and  J = 1,2,...,N.
C
C     The indices I+1 and I-1 are evaluated modulo M, i.e.,
C     X(0,J) = X(M,J) and X(M+1,J) = X(1,J), and X(I,0) may be equal to
C     0, X(I,2), or X(I,N) and X(I,N+1) may be equal to 0, X(I,N-1), or
C     X(I,1) depending on an input parameter.

C
C     NPEROD
C       Indicates the values that X(I,0) and X(I,N+1) are assumed to
C       have.
C
C       = 0  If X(I,0) = X(I,N) and X(I,N+1) = X(I,1).
C       = 1  If X(I,0) = X(I,N+1) = 0  .
C       = 2  If X(I,0) = 0 and X(I,N+1) = X(I,N-1).
C       = 3  If X(I,0) = X(I,2) and X(I,N+1) = X(I,N-1).
C       = 4  If X(I,0) = X(I,2) and X(I,N+1) = 0.
C
C     N
C       The number of unknowns in the J-direction.  N must be greater
C       than 2.
C
C     MPEROD
C       = 0 If A(1) and C(M) are not zero
C       = 1 If A(1) = C(M) = 0
C
C     M
C       The number of unknowns in the I-direction.  N must be greater
C       than 2.
C
C     A,B,C
C       One-dimensional complex arrays of length M that specify the
C       coefficients in the linear equations given above.  If MPEROD = 0
C       the array elements must not depend upon the index I, but must be
C       constant.  Specifically, the subroutine checks the following
C       condition
C
C             A(I) = C(1)
C             C(I) = C(1)
C             B(I) = B(1)
C
C       For I=1,2,...,M.
C
C     IDIMY
C       The row (or first) dimension of the two-dimensional array Y as
C       it appears in the program calling CMGNBN.  This parameter is
C       used to specify the variable dimension of Y.  IDIMY must be at
C       least M.
C
C     Y
C       A two-dimensional complex array that specifies the values of the
C       right side of the linear system of equations given above.  Y
C       must be dimensioned at least M*N.
C
C     W
C       A one-dimensional complex array that must be provided by the
C       user for work space.  W may require up to 4*N +
C       (10 + INT(log2(N)))*M LOCATIONS.  The actual number of locations
C       used is computed by CMGNBN and is returned in location W(1).

C
C     Y

C
C     IERROR
C       An error flag which indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C       for number zero, a solution is not attempted.
C
C       = 0  No error.

C     History        Written by Roland Sweet at NCAR in June, 1977
C
C     Algorithm      The linear system is solved by a cyclic reduction
C                    algorithm described in the reference.

C
C     Timing and      The execution time T on the NCAR Control Data
C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine CMGNBN is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N), but also depends on the input
C                    parameter NPEROD.  Some typical values are listed
C                    in the table below.
C                       To measure the accuracy of the algorithm a
C                    uniform random number generator was used to create
C                    a solution array X for the system given in the
C                    'PURPOSE' with
C
C                       A(I) = C(I) = -0.5*B(I) = 1,       I=1,2,...,M
C
C                    and, when MPEROD = 1
C
C                       A(1) = C(M) = 0
C                       A(M) = C(1) = 2.
C
C                    The solution X was substituted into the given sys-
C                    tem and a right side Y was computed.  Using this
C                    array Y subroutine CMGNBN was called to produce an
C                    approximate solution Z.  Then the relative error,
C                    defined as
C
C                       E = MAX(CABS(Z(I,J)-X(I,J)))/MAX(CABS(X(I,J)))
C
C                    where the two maxima are taken over all I=1,2,...,M
C                    and J=1,2,...,N, was computed.  The value of E is
C                    given in the table below for some typical values of
C                    M and N.
