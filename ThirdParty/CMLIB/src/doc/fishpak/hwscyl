C***PURPOSE  Subroutine HWSCYL solves a standard finite difference
C            approximation to the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical
C            coordinates.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutine HWSCYL solves a finite difference approximation to the
C     Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates:
C
C          (1/R)(d/dR)(R(dU/dR)) + (d/dZ)(dU/dZ)
C
C                                + (LAMBDA/R**2)U = F(R,Z)
C
C     This modified Helmholtz equation results from the Fourier
C     transform of the three-dimensional Poisson equation.

C
C       When NBDCND has any other value, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C     ELMBDA
C       The constant LAMBDA in the Helmholtz equation.  If
C       LAMBDA .GT. 0, a solution may not exist.  However, HWSCYL will
C       attempt to find a solution.  LAMBDA must be zero when
C       MBDCND = 5 or 6  .
C
C     F
C       A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C       side of the Helmholtz equation and boundary data (if any).  For
C       I = 2,3,...,M and J = 2,3,...,N
C
C            F(I,J) = F(R(I),Z(J)).

C
C       F must be dimensioned at least (M+1)*(N+1).
C
C       NOTE
C
C       If the table calls for both the solution U and the right side F
C       at a corner then the solution must be specified.
C
C     IDIMF
C       The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C       program calling HWSCYL.  This parameter is used to specify the
C       variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M+1  .
C
C     W
C       A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C       work space.  W may require up to 4*(N+1) +
C       (13 + INT(log2(N+1)))*(M+1) locations.  The actual number of
C       locations used is computed by HWSCYL and is returned in location
C       W(1).
C
C
C             * * * * * *   On Output     * * * * * *
C
C     F
C       Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C       approximation for the grid point (R(I),Z(J)), I = 1,2,...,M+1,
C       J = 1,2,...,N+1  .
C
C     PERTRB
C       If one specifies a combination of periodic, derivative, and
C       unspecified boundary conditions for a Poisson equation
C       (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a constant,
C       calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures that a solution
C       exists.  HWSCYL then computes this solution, which is a least
C       squares solution to the original approximation.  This solution
C       plus any constant is also a solution.  Hence, the solution is
C       not unique.  The value of PERTRB should be small compared to the
C       right side F.  Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an
C       essentially different problem.  This comparison should always
C       be made to insure that a meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C     IERROR
C       An error flag which indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C       for numbers 0 and 11, a solution is not attempted.
C
C       =  0  No error.
C       =  1  A .LT. 0  .
C       =  2  A .GE. B.
C       =  3  MBDCND .LT. 1 or MBDCND .GT. 6  .
C       =  4  C .GE. D.
C       =  5  N .LE. 3
C       =  6  NBDCND .LT. 0 or NBDCND .GT. 4  .
C       =  7  A = 0, MBDCND = 3 or 4  .
C       =  8  A .GT. 0, MBDCND .GE. 5  .
C       =  9  A = 0, LAMBDA .NE. 0, MBDCND .GE. 5  .
C       = 10  IDIMF .LT. M+1  .
C       = 11  LAMBDA .GT. 0  .
C       = 12  M .LE. 3
C
C       Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly incorrect
C       call to HWSCYL, the user should test IERROR after the call.
C
C     W
C       W(1) contains the required length of W.

C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HWSCYL is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N), but also depends on the input
