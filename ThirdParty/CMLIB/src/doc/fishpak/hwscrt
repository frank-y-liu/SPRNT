C
C       When NBDCND has any other value, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C     ELMBDA
C       The constant LAMBDA in the Helmholtz equation.  If
C       LAMBDA .GT. 0, a solution may not exist.  However, HWSCRT will
C       attempt to find a solution.
C
C     F
C       A two-dimensional array which specifies the values of the right
C       side of the Helmholtz equation and boundary values (if any).
C       For I = 2,3,...,M and J = 2,3,...,N
C
C            F(I,J) = F(X(I),Y(J)).

C              2        U(A,Y(J))     F(B,Y(J))     J = 1,2,...,N+1

C              1        U(X(I),C)     U(X(I),D)
C              2        U(X(I),C)     F(X(I),D)     I = 1,2,...,M+1
C              3        F(X(I),C)     F(X(I),D)
C              4        F(X(I),C)     U(X(I),D)
C
C       F must be dimensioned at least (M+1)*(N+1).
C
C       NOTE:
C
C       If the table calls for both the solution U and the right side F
C       at a corner then the solution must be specified.
C
C     IDIMF
C       The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C       program calling HWSCRT.  This parameter is used to specify the
C       variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M+1  .
C
C     W
C       A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C       work space.  W may require up to 4*(N+1) +
C       (13 + INT(log2(N+1)))*(M+1) locations.  The actual number of
C       locations used is computed by HWSCRT and is returned in location
C       W(1).
C
C
C             * * * * * *   On Output     * * * * * *
C
C     F
C       Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C       approximation for the grid point (X(I),Y(J)), I = 1,2,...,M+1,
C       J = 1,2,...,N+1  .
C
C     PERTRB
C       If a combination of periodic or derivative boundary conditions
C       is specified for a Poisson equation (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may
C       not exist.  PERTRB is a constant, calculated and subtracted from
C       F, which ensures that a solution exists.  HWSCRT then computes
C       this solution, which is a least squares solution to the original
C       approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also a
C       solution.  Hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of
C       PERTRB should be small compared to the right side F.  Otherwise,
C       a solution is obtained to an essentially different problem.
C       This comparison should always be made to insure that a
C       meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C     IERROR
C       An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C       for numbers 0 and 6, a solution is not attempted.
C
C       = 0  No error.
C       = 1  A .GE. B.
C       = 2  MBDCND .LT. 0 or MBDCND .GT. 4  .
C       = 3  C .GE. D.
C       = 4  N .LE. 3
C       = 5  NBDCND .LT. 0 or NBDCND .GT. 4  .
C       = 6  LAMBDA .GT. 0  .
C       = 7  IDIMF .LT. M+1  .
C       = 8  M .LE. 3
C
C       Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly incorrect
C       call to HWSCRT, the user should test IERROR after the call.
C
C     W
C       W(1) contains the required length of W.

C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HWSCRT is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N), but also depends on the input
C                    parameters NBDCND and MBDCND.  Some typical values
C                    are listed in the table below.
C                       The solution process employed results in a loss
