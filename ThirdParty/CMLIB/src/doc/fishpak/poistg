C***PURPOSE  Solves a block tridiagonal system of linear equations
C            that results from a staggered grid finite difference
C            approximation to 2-d elliptic PDE's.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutine POISTG solves the linear system of equations
C
C       A(I)*X(I-1,J) + B(I)*X(I,J) + C(I)*X(I+1,J)
C       + X(I,J-1) - 2.*X(I,J) + X(I,J+1) = Y(I,J)
C
C       for I=1,2,...,M and J=1,2,...,N.
C
C     The indices I+1 and I-1 are evaluated modulo M, i.e.
C     X(0,J) = X(M,J) and X(M+1,J) = X(1,J), and X(I,0) may be equal to
C     X(I,1) or -X(I,1) and X(I,N+1) may be equal to X(I,N) or -X(I,N)
C     depending on an input parameter.

C
C   NPEROD
C     Indicates the values which X(I,0) and X(I,N+1) are assumed
C     to have.
C     = 1 If X(I,0) = -X(I,1) and X(I,N+1) = -X(I,N)
C     = 2 If X(I,0) = -X(I,1) and X(I,N+1) =  X(I,N)
C     = 3 If X(I,0) =  X(I,1) and X(I,N+1) =  X(I,N)
C     = 4 If X(I,0) =  X(I,1) and X(I,N+1) = -X(I,N)
C
C   N
C     The number of unknowns in the J-direction.  N must
C     be greater than 2.
C
C   MPEROD
C     = 0 If A(1) and C(M) are not zero
C     = 1 If A(1) = C(M) = 0
C
C   M
C     The number of unknowns in the I-direction.  M must
C     be greater than 2.
C
C   A,B,C
C     One-dimensional arrays of length M that specify the coefficients
C     in the linear equations given above.  If MPEROD = 0 the array
C     elements must not depend on the index I, but must be constant.
C     Specifically, the subroutine checks the following condition
C
C           A(I) = C(1)
C           B(I) = B(1)
C           C(I) = C(1)
C
C     for I = 1, 2, ..., M.
C
C   IDIMY
C     The row (or first) dimension of the two-dimensional array Y as
C     it appears in the program calling POISTG.  This parameter is
C     used to specify the variable dimension of Y.  IDIMY must be at
C     least M.
C
C   Y
C     A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the
C     right side of the linear system of equations given above.
C     Y must be dimensioned at least M X N.
C
C   W
C     A one-dimensional work array that must be provided by the user
C     for work space.  W may require up to 9M + 4N + M(INT(log2(N)))
C     locations.  The actual number of locations used is computed by
C     POISTG and returned in location W(1).

C
C   Y

C
C   IERROR
C     An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C     for number zero, a solution is not attempted.
C     = 0  No error
C     = 1  If M .LE. 2
C     = 2  If N .LE. 2
C     = 3  IDIMY .LT. M
C     = 4  If NPEROD .LT. 1 or NPEROD .GT. 4
C     = 5  If MPEROD .LT. 0 or MPEROD .GT. 1
C     = 6  If MPEROD = 0 and
C          A(I) .NE. C(1) or B(I) .NE. B(1) or C(I) .NE. C(1)
C          for some I = 1, 2, ..., M.
C       = 7 If MPEROD .EQ. 1 .AND. (A(1).NE.0 .OR. C(M).NE.0)

C
C     Timing and        The execution time T on the NCAR Control Data
C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine POISTG is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N).  Some typical values are listed
C                    in the table below.  More comprehensive timing
C                    charts may be found in the reference.
C                       To measure the accuracy of the algorithm a
C                    uniform random number generator was used to create
C                    a solution array X for the system given in the
C                    'PURPOSE ' with
C
C                       A(I) = C(I) = -0.5*B(I) = 1,       I=1,2,...,M
C
C                    and, when MPEROD = 1
C
C                       A(1) = C(M) = 0
C                       B(1) = B(M) =-1.
C
C                    The solution X was substituted into the given sys-
C                    tem and, using double precision, a right side Y was
C                    computed.  Using this array Y subroutine POISTG was
C                    called to produce an approximate solution Z.  Then
C                    the relative error, defined as
C
C                       E = MAX(ABS(Z(I,J)-X(I,J)))/MAX(ABS(X(I,J)))

C                    where the two maxima are taken over all I=1,2,...,M
C                    and J=1,2,...,N, was computed.  The value of E is
C                    given in the table below for some typical values of
C                    M and N.
