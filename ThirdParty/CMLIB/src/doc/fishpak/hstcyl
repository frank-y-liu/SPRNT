C***DESCRIPTION
C
C      HSTCYL solves the standard five-point finite difference
C      approximation on a staggered grid to the modified Helmholtz
C      equation in cylindrical coordinates
C
C          (1/R)(d/dR)(R(dU/dR)) + (d/dZ)(dU/dZ)C
C                      + LAMBDA*(1/R**2)*U = F(R,Z)
C
C      This two-dimensional modified Helmholtz equation results
C      from the Fourier transform of a three-dimensional Poisson
C      equation.

C      A must be non-negative.
C
C    M
C      The number of grid points in the interval (A,B).  The grid points
C      in the R-direction are given by R(I) = A + (I-0.5)DR for
C      I=1,2,...,M where DR =(B-A)/M.  M must be greater than 2.
C
C    MBDCND
C      Indicates the type of boundary conditions at R = A and R = B.
C
C      = 1  If the solution is specified at R = A (see note below) and
C           R = B.
C
C      = 2  If the solution is specified at R = A (see note below) and
C           the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C           specified at R = B.
C
C      = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C           specified at R = A (see note below) and R = B.
C
C      = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C           specified at R = A (see note below) and the solution is
C           specified at R = B.
C
C      = 5  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the solution
C           is specified at R = B.
C
C      = 6  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the
C           derivative of the solution with respect to R is specified at

C
C      NOTE:  If A = 0, do not use MBDCND = 1,2,3, or 4, but instead
C             use MBDCND = 5 or 6.  The resulting approximation gives
C             the only meaningful boundary condition, i.e. dU/dR = 0.

C      the Z-direction are given by Z(J) = C + (J-0.5)DZ,
C      J=1,2,...,N, where DZ = (D-C)/N.  N must be greater than 2.
C
C    NBDCND
C      Indicates the type of boundary conditions at Z = C
C      and Z = D.
C
C      = 0  If the solution is periodic in Z, i.e.
C           U(I,J) = U(I,N+J).
C
C      = 1  If the solution is specified at Z = C and Z = D.
C
C      = 2  If the solution is specified at Z = C and the derivative
C           of the solution with respect to Z is specified at
C           Z = D.
C

C           specified at Z = C and Z = D.
C
C      = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to Z is

C      values of the solution at Z = D.  when NBDCND = 1 or 4,
C
C               BDD(I) = U(R(I),D) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
C
C               BDD(I) = (d/dZ)U(R(I),D) ,        I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 0, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C    ELMBDA
C      The constant LAMBDA in the modified Helmholtz equation.  If
C      LAMBDA is greater than 0, a solution may not exist.  However,
C      HSTCYL will attempt to find a solution.  LAMBDA must be zero
C      when MBDCND = 5 or 6.
C
C    F
C      A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C      side of the modified Helmholtz equation.  For I=1,2,...,M
C      and J=1,2,...,N
C
C               F(I,J) = F(R(I),Z(J)) .
C
C      F must be dimensioned at least M X N.
C
C    IDIMF
C      The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C      program calling HSTCYL.  This parameter is used to specify the
C      variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M.
C
C    W
C      A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C      work space.  W may require up to 13M + 4N + M*INT(log2(N))
C      locations.  The actual number of locations used is computed by
C      HSTCYL and is returned in the location W(1).
C

C             * * * * * *   On Output   * * * * * *
C
C    F
C      Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C      approximation for the grid point (R(I),Z(J)) for
C      I=1,2,...,M, J=1,2,...,N.
C
C    PERTRB
C      If a combination of periodic, derivative, or unspecified
C      boundary conditions is specified for a Poisson equation
C      (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a con-
C      stant, calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures
C      that a solution exists.  HSTCYL then computes this
C      solution, which is a least squares solution to the
C      original approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also
C      a solution; hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of
C      PERTRB should be small compared to the right side F.
C      Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an essentially different
C      problem.  This comparison should always be made to insure that
C      a meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C    IERROR
C      An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.
C      Except for numbers 0 and 11, a solution is not attempted.
C
C      =  0  No error
C
C      =  1  A .LT. 0
C
C      =  2  A .GE. B
C
C      =  3  MBDCND .LT. 1 or MBDCND .GT. 6
C
C      =  4  C .GE. D
C
C      =  5  N .LE. 2
C
C      =  6  NBDCND .LT. 0 or NBDCND .GT. 4
C
C      =  7  A = 0 and MBDCND = 1,2,3, or 4
C
C      =  8  A .GT. 0 and MBDCND .GE. 5
C
C      =  9  M .LE. 2
C
C      = 10  IDIMF .LT. M
C
C      = 11  LAMBDA .GT. 0
C
C      = 12  A=0, MBDCND .GE. 5, ELMBDA .NE. 0
C
C      Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly
C      incorrect call to HSTCYL, the user should test IERROR after
C      the call.
C
C    W
C      W(1) contains the required length of W.

C
C     Algorithm      This subroutine defines the finite-difference
C                    equations, incorporates boundary data, adjusts the
C                    right side when the system is singular and calls
C                    either POISTG or GENBUN which solves the linear
C                    system of equations.

C     Timing and        The execution time T on the NCAR Control Data
C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HSTCYL is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N).  Some typical values are listed in
C                    the table below.
C                       The solution process employed results in a loss
C                    of no more than four significant digits for N and M
C                    as large as 64.  More detailed information about
C                    accuracy can be found in the documentation for
C                    subroutine POISTG which is the routine that
C                    actually solves the finite difference equations.
