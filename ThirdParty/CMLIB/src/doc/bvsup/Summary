C     SUBROUTINE BVSUP SOLVES A LINEAR TWO-POINT BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM
C     OF THE FORM
C                        DY/DX = MATRIX(X,U)*Y(X) + G(X,U)
C                A*Y(XINITIAL) = ALPHA ,  B*Y(XFINAL) = BETA
C
C     COUPLED WITH THE SOLUTION OF THE INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM
C
C                        DU/DX = F(X,U)
C                      U(XINITIAL) = ETA

C     ABSTRACT
C        THE METHOD OF SOLUTION USES SUPERPOSITION COUPLED WITH AN
C     ORTHONORMALIZATION PROCEDURE AND A VARIABLE-STEP INTEGRATION
C     SCHEME.  EACH TIME THE SUPERPOSITION SOLUTIONS START TO
C     LOSE THEIR NUMERICAL LINEAR INDEPENDENCE, THE VECTORS ARE
C     REORTHONORMALIZED BEFORE INTEGRATION PROCEEDS.  THE UNDERLYING
C     PRINCIPLE OF THE ALGORITHM IS THEN TO PIECE TOGETHER THE
C     INTERMEDIATE (ORTHOGONALIZED) SOLUTIONS, DEFINED ON THE VARIOUS
C     SUBINTERVALS, TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED SOLUTIONS.
