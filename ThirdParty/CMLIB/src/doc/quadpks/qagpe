C                     Upper limit of integration
C
C            NPTS2  - Integer
C                     Number equal to two more than the number of
C                     user-supplied break points within the integration
C                     range, NPTS2.GE.2.
C                     If NPTS2.LT.2, the routine will end with IER = 6.

C                     elements of which are the user provided break
C                     POINTS. If these POINTS do not constitute an
C                     ascending sequence there will be an automatic

C                     Absolute accuracy requested
C            EPSREL - Real
C                     Relative accuracy requested
C                     If  EPSABS.LE.0
C                     and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28),
C                     the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C            LIMIT  - Integer
C                     Gives an upper bound on the number of subintervals
C                     in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.NPTS2
C                     If LIMIT.LT.NPTS2, the routine will end with
C                     IER = 6.
C
C         ON RETURN
C            RESULT - Real
C                     Approximation to the integral
C
C            ABSERR - Real
C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)

C                             routine. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has been achieved.
C                     IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine.
C                             The estimates for integral and error are
C                             less reliable. It is assumed that the
C                             requested accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties. If
C                             the position of a local difficulty can be
C                             determined (i.e. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval), it
C                             should be supplied to the routine as an
C                             element of the vector points. If necessary
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             must be used, which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             At some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 4 The algorithm does not converge.
C                             Roundoff error is detected in the
C                             extrapolation table. It is presumed that
C                             the requested tolerance cannot be
C                             achieved, and that the returned result is
C                             the best which can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. It must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.GT.0.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid because
C                             NPTS2.LT.2 or
C                             Break points are specified outside
C                             the integration range or
C                             (EPSABS.LE.0 and
C                              EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28))
C                             or LIMIT.LT.NPTS2.

C                             and ELIST(1) are set to zero. ALIST(1) and

C                     some of the intervals may have been increased
