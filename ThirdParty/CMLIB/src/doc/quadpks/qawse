C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                         = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT. However, if this yields no
C                             improvement, it is advised to analyze the
C                             integrand in order to determine the
C                             integration difficulties which prevent the
C                             requested tolerance from being achieved.
C                             In case of a jump DISCONTINUITY or a local

C                             at one or more interior points of the
C                             integration range, one should proceed by
C                             splitting up the interval at these
C                             points and calling the integrator on the
C                             subranges.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
