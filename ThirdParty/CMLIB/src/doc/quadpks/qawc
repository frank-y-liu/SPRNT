C***PURPOSE  The routine calculates an approximation result to a
C            Cauchy principal value I = INTEGRAL of F*W over (A,B)
C            (W(X) = 1/((X-C), C.NE.A, C.NE.B), hopefully satisfying
C            following claim for accuracy
C            ABS(I-RESULT).LE.MAX(EPSABE,EPSREL*ABS(I)).

C                     If C = A or C = B, the routine will end with

C                             routine. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has been achieved.

C                             the estimates for integral and error are

C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more sub-
C                             divisions by increasing the value of LIMIT
C                             (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties.
C                             If the position of a local difficulty
C                             can be determined (e.g. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one
C                             will probably gain from splitting up the
C                             interval at this point and calling
C                             appropriate integrators on the subranges.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is detec-
C                             ted, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid, because
C                             C = A or C = B or
C                             (EPSABS.LE.0 and
C                              EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28))
C                             or LIMIT.LT.1 or LENW.LT.LIMIT*4.
C                             RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, LAST are set to
C                             zero. Exept when LENW or LIMIT is invalid,
C                             IWORK(1), WORK(LIMIT*2+1) and
C                             WORK(LIMIT*3+1) are set to zero, WORK(1)
C                             is set to A and WORK(LIMIT+1) to B.

C                    On return, LAST equals the number of subintervals
C                    produced in the subdivision process, which
C                    determines the number of significant elements
C                    actually in the WORK ARRAYS.

C                    such that WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(1)), ... ,
C                    WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(K)) form a decreasing
C                    sequence, with K = LAST if LAST.LE.(LIMIT/2+2),
C                    and K = LIMIT+1-LAST otherwise
