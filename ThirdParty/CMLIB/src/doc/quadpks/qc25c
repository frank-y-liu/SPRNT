C***PURPOSE  To compute I = Integral of F*W over (A,B) with
C            error estimate, where W(X) = 1/(X-C)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C        Integration rules for the computation of CAUCHY
C        PRINCIPAL VALUE integrals
C        Standard fortran subroutine
C        Real version
C
C        PARAMETERS
C           F      - Real
C                    Function subprogram defining the integrand function
C                    F(X). The actual name for F needs to be declared
C                    E X T E R N A L  in the driver program.
C
C           A      - Real
C                    Left end point of the integration interval
C
C           B      - Real
C                    Right end point of the integration interval, B.GT.A
C
C           C      - Real
C                    Parameter in the WEIGHT function
C
C           RESULT - Real
C                    Approximation to the integral
C                    result is computed by using a generalized
C                    Clenshaw-Curtis method if C lies within ten percent
C                    of the integration interval. In the other case the
C                    15-point Kronrod rule obtained by optimal addition
C                    of abscissae to the 7-point Gauss rule, is applied.
C
C           ABSERR - Real
C                    Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                    which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C           KRUL   - Integer
C                    Key which is decreased by 1 if the 15-point
C                    Gauss-Kronrod scheme has been used
C
C           NEVAL  - Integer
C                    Number of integrand evaluations
