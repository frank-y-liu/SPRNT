C     Subroutine DOGLEG
C
C     Given an M by N matrix A, an N by N nonsingular DIAGONAL
C     matrix D, an M-vector B, and a positive number DELTA, the
C     problem is to determine the convex combination X of the
C     Gauss-Newton and scaled gradient directions that minimizes
C     (A*X - B) in the least squares sense, subject to the
C     restriction that the Euclidean norm of D*X be at most DELTA.
C
C     This subroutine completes the solution of the problem
C     if it is provided with the necessary information from the
C     QR factorization of A. That is, if A = Q*R, where Q has
C     orthogonal columns and R is an upper triangular matrix,
C     then DOGLEG expects the full upper triangle of R and
C     the first N components of (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE DOGLEG(N,R,LR,DIAG,QTB,DELTA,X,WA1,WA2)
C
C     where
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the order of R.
C
C       R is an input array of length LR which must contain the upper
C         triangular matrix R stored by rows.
C
C       LR is a positive integer input variable not less than
C         (N*(N+1))/2.
C
C       DIAG is an input array of length N which must contain the
C         diagonal elements of the matrix D.
C
C       QTB is an input array of length N which must contain the first
C         N elements of the vector (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
C
C       DELTA is a positive input variable which specifies an upper
C         bound on the Euclidean norm of D*X.
C
C       X is an output array of length N which contains the desired
C         convex combination of the Gauss-Newton direction and the
C         scaled gradient direction.
C
C       WA1 and WA2 are work arrays of length N.
