C***DESCRIPTION
C
C 1. Purpose.
C
C       The purpose of SNLS1 is to minimize the sum of the squares of M
C       nonlinear functions in N variables by a modification of the
C       Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.  The user must provide a subrou-
C       tine which calculates the functions.  The user has the option
C       of how the Jacobian will be supplied.  The user can supply the
C       full Jacobian, or the rows of the Jacobian (to avoid storing
C       the full Jacobian), or let the code approximate the Jacobian by
C       forward-differencing.   This code is the combination of the
C       MINPACK codes (Argonne) LMDER, LMDIF, and LMSTR.

C 3. Parameters.
C
C       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
C       entry to SNLS1 and are not changed on exit, while parameters
C       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
C       and are set to appropriate values on exit from SNLS1.
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the functions.  If the user wants to supply the Jacobian
C         (IOPT=2 or 3), then FCN must be written to calculate the
C         Jacobian, as well as the functions.  See the explanation
C         of the IOPT argument below.
C         If the user wants the iterates printed (NPRINT positive), then
C         FCN must do the printing.  See the explanation of NPRINT
C         below.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement in the
C         calling program and should be written as follows.
C
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(IFLAG,M,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC)
C         INTEGER IFLAG,LDFJAC,M,N
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(M)
C         ----------
C         FJAC and LDFJAC may be ignored     , if IOPT=1.
C         REAL FJAC(LDFJAC,N)                , if IOPT=2.
C         REAL FJAC(N)                       , if IOPT=3.
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=0, the values in X and FVEC are available
C           for printing.  See the explanation of NPRINT below.
C           IFLAG will never be zero unless NPRINT is positive.
C           The values of X and FVEC must not be changed.
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=1, calculate the functions at X and return
C           this vector in FVEC.
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=2, calculate the full Jacobian at X and return
C           this matrix in FJAC.  Note that IFLAG will never be 2 unless
C           IOPT=2.  FVEC contains the function values at X and must
C           not be altered.  FJAC(I,J) must be set to the derivative
C           of FVEC(I) with respect to X(J).
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C           If IFLAG=3, calculate the LDFJAC-th row of the Jacobian
C           and return this vector in FJAC.  Note that IFLAG will
C           never be 3 unless IOPT=3.  FVEC contains the function
C           values at X and must not be altered.  FJAC(J) must be
C           set to the derivative of FVEC(LDFJAC) with respect to X(J).
C         RETURN
C         ----------
C         END
C
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of SNLS1.  In this case, set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C
C       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
C         be calculated.  If IOPT=2 or 3, then the user must supply the
C         Jacobian, as well as the function values, through the
C         subroutine FCN.  If IOPT=2, the user supplies the full
C         Jacobian with one call to FCN.  If IOPT=3, the user supplies
C         one row of the Jacobian with each call.  (In this manner,
C         storage can be saved because the full Jacobian is not stored.)
C         If IOPT=1, the code will approximate the Jacobian by forward
C         differencing.
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         functions.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         variables.  N must not exceed M.
C
C       X is an array of length N.  On input, X must contain an initial
C         estimate of the solution vector.  On output, X contains the
C         final estimate of the solution vector.
C
C       FVEC is an output array of length M which contains the functions
C         evaluated at the output X.
C
C       FJAC is an output array.  For IOPT=1 and 2, FJAC is an M by N
C         array.  For IOPT=3, FJAC is an N by N array.  The upper N by N
C         submatrix of FJAC contains an upper triangular matrix R with
C         diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude such that
C
C                T     T           T
C               P *(JAC *JAC)*P = R *R,
C
C         where P is a permutation matrix and JAC is the final calcu-
C         lated Jacobian.  Column J of P is column IPVT(J) (see below)
C         of the identity matrix.  The lower part of FJAC contains
C         information generated during the computation of R.
C
C       LDFJAC is a positive integer input variable which specifies
C         the leading dimension of the array FJAC.  For IOPT=1 and 2,
C         LDFJAC must not be less than M.  For IOPT=3, LDFJAC must not
C         be less than N.
C
C       FTOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         both the actual and predicted relative reductions in the sum
C         of squares are at most FTOL.  Therefore, FTOL measures the
C         relative error desired in the sum of squares.  Section 4 con-
C         tains more details about FTOL.
C
C       XTOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         the relative error between two consecutive iterates is at most
C         XTOL.  Therefore, XTOL measures the relative error desired in
C         the approximate solution.  Section 4 contains more details
C         about XTOL.
C
C       GTOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         the cosine of the angle between FVEC and any column of the
C         Jacobian is at most GTOL in absolute value.  Therefore, GTOL
C         measures the orthogonality desired between the function vector
C         and the columns of the Jacobian.  Section 4 contains more
C         details about GTOL.
C
C       MAXFEV is a positive integer input variable.  Termination occurs
C         when the number of calls to FCN to evaluate the functions
C         has reached MAXFEV.
C
C       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable step
C         for the forward-difference approximation.  This approximation
C         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
C         order of EPSFCN.  If EPSFCN is less than the machine preci-
C         sion, it is assumed that the relative errors in the functions
C         are of the order of the machine precision.  If IOPT=2 or 3,
C         then EPSFCN can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
C
C       DIAG is an array of length N.  If MODE = 1 (see below), DIAG is
C         internally set.  If MODE = 2, DIAG must contain positive
C         entries that serve as implicit (multiplicative) scale factors
C         for the variables.
C
C       MODE is an integer input variable.  If MODE = 1, the variables
C         will be scaled internally.  If MODE = 2, the scaling is speci-
C         fied by the input DIAG.  Other values of MODE are equivalent
C         to MODE = 1.
C
C       FACTOR is a positive input variable used in determining the ini-
C         tial step bound.  This bound is set to the product of FACTOR
C         and the Euclidean norm of DIAG*X if nonzero, or else to FACTOR
C         itself.  In most cases FACTOR should lie in the interval
C         (.1,100.).  100. is a generally recommended value.
C
C       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
C         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
C         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
C         and every NPRINT iterations thereafter and immediately prior
C         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
C         print statements must be added to FCN (see example) and
C         FVEC should not be altered.  If NPRINT is not positive, no
C         special calls to FCN with IFLAG = 0 are made.
C
C       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
C         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
C         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
C
C         INFO = 0  improper input parameters.
C
C         INFO = 1  both actual and predicted relative reductions in the
C                   sum of squares are at most FTOL.
C
C         INFO = 2  relative error between two consecutive iterates is
C                   at most XTOL.
C
C         INFO = 3  conditions for INFO = 1 and INFO = 2 both hold.
C
C         INFO = 4  the cosine of the angle between FVEC and any column
C                   of the Jacobian is at most GTOL in absolute value.
C
C         INFO = 5  number of calls to FCN for function evaluation
C                   has reached MAXFEV.
C
C         INFO = 6  FTOL is too small.  No further reduction in the sum
C                   of squares is possible.
C
C         INFO = 7  XTOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
C                   approximate solution X is possible.
C
C         INFO = 8  GTOL is too small.  FVEC is orthogonal to the
C                   columns of the Jacobian to machine precision.
C
C         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
C
C       NFEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
C         FCN for function evaluation.
C
C       NJEV is an integer output variable set to the number of
C         evaluations of the full Jacobian.  If IOPT=2, only one call to
C         FCN is required for each evaluation of the full Jacobian.
C         If IOPT=3, the M calls to FCN are required.
C         If IOPT=1, then NJEV is set to zero.
C
C       IPVT is an integer output array of length N.  IPVT defines a
C         permutation matrix P such that JAC*P = Q*R, where JAC is the
C         final calculated Jacobian, Q is orthogonal (not stored), and R
C         is upper triangular with diagonal elements of nonincreasing
C         magnitude.  Column J of P is column IPVT(J) of the identity
C         matrix.
C
C       QTF is an output array of length N which contains the first N
C         elements of the vector (Q transpose)*FVEC.
C
C       WA1, WA2, and WA3 are work arrays of length N.
C
C       WA4 is a work array of length M.
C
C
C 4. Successful Completion.
C
C       The accuracy of SNLS1 is controlled by the convergence parame-
C       ters FTOL, XTOL, and GTOL.  These parameters are used in tests
C       which make three types of comparisons between the approximation
C       X and a solution XSOL.  SNLS1 terminates when any of the tests
C       is satisfied.  If any of the convergence parameters is less than
C       the machine precision (as defined by the function R1MACH(4)),
C       then SNLS1 only attempts to satisfy the test defined by the
C       machine precision.  Further progress is not usually possible.
C
C       The tests assume that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
C       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
C       and the Jacobian are coded consistently.  If these conditions
C       are not satisfied, then SNLS1 may incorrectly indicate conver-
C       gence.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=1,
C       then the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
C       rerunning SNLS1 with tighter tolerances.
C
C       First Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm
C         of a vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that
C
C               ENORM(FVEC) .LE. (1+FTOL)*ENORM(FVECS),
C
C         where FVECS denotes the functions evaluated at XSOL.  If this
C         condition is satisfied with FTOL = 10**(-K), then the final
C         residual norm ENORM(FVEC) has K significant decimal digits and
C         INFO is set to 1 (or to 3 if the second test is also satis-
C         fied).  Unless high precision solutions are required, the
C         recommended value for FTOL is the square root of the machine
C         precision.
C
C       Second Convergence Test.  If D is the diagonal matrix whose
C         entries are defined by the array DIAG, then this test attempts
C         to guarantee that
C
C               ENORM(D*(X-XSOL)) .LE. XTOL*ENORM(D*XSOL).
C
C         If this condition is satisfied with XTOL = 10**(-K), then the
C         larger components of D*X have K significant decimal digits and
C         INFO is set to 2 (or to 3 if the first test is also satis-
C         fied).  There is a danger that the smaller components of D*X
C         may have large relative errors, but if MODE = 1, then the
C         accuracy of the components of X is usually related to their
C         sensitivity.  Unless high precision solutions are required,
C         the recommended value for XTOL is the square root of the
C         machine precision.
C
C       Third Convergence Test.  This test is satisfied when the cosine
C         of the angle between FVEC and any column of the Jacobian at X
C         is at most GTOL in absolute value.  There is no clear rela-
C         tionship between this test and the accuracy of SNLS1, and
C         furthermore, the test is equally well satisfied at other crit-
C         ical points, namely maximizers and saddle points.  Therefore,
C         termination caused by this test (INFO = 4) should be examined
C         carefully.  The recommended value for GTOL is zero.
C
C
C 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
C
C       Unsuccessful termination of SNLS1 can be due to improper input
C       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, or an excessive number of
C       function evaluations.
C
C       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT .LT. 1
C         or IOPT .GT. 3, or N .LE. 0, or M .LT. N, or for IOPT=1 or 2
C         LDFJAC .LT. M, or for IOPT=3 LDFJAC .LT. N, or FTOL .LT. 0.E0,
C         or XTOL .LT. 0.E0, or GTOL .LT. 0.E0, or MAXFEV .LE. 0, or
C         FACTOR .LE. 0.E0.
C
C       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
C         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
C         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by SNLS1.  In this
C         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by rerunning
C         SNLS1 with a smaller value of FACTOR.
C
C       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  A reasonable value
C         for MAXFEV is 100*(N+1) for IOPT=2 or 3 and 200*(N+1) for
C         IOPT=1.  If the number of calls to FCN reaches MAXFEV, then
C         this indicates that the routine is converging very slowly
C         as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is set to 5.
C         In this case, it may be helpful to restart SNLS1 with MODE
C         set to 1.
C
C
C 6. Characteristics of the Algorithm.
C
C       SNLS1 is a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
C       Two of its main characteristics involve the proper use of
C       implicitly scaled variables (if MODE = 1) and an optimal choice
C       for the correction.  The use of implicitly scaled variables
C       achieves scale invariance of SNLS1 and limits the size of the
C       correction in any direction where the functions are changing
C       rapidly.  The optimal choice of the correction guarantees (under
C       reasonable conditions) global convergence from starting points
C       far from the solution and a fast rate of convergence for
C       problems with small residuals.
C
C       Timing.  The time required by SNLS1 to solve a given problem
C         depends on M and N, the behavior of the functions, the accu-
C         racy requested, and the starting point.  The number of arith-
C         metic operations needed by SNLS1 is about N**3 to process each
C         evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and to process each
C         evaluation of the Jacobian it takes M*N**2 for IOPT=2 (one
C         call to FCN), M*N**2 for IOPT=1 (N calls to FCN) and
C         1.5*M*N**2 for IOPT=3 (M calls to FCN).  Unless FCN
C         can be evaluated quickly, the timing of SNLS1 will be
C         strongly influenced by the time spent in FCN.
C
C       Storage.  SNLS1 requires (M*N + 2*M + 6*N) for IOPT=1 or 2 and
C         (N**2 + 2*M + 6*N) for IOPT=3 single precision storage
C         locations and N integer storage locations, in addition to
C         the storage required by the program.  There are no internally
C         declared storage arrays.

C
C       The problem is to determine the values of X(1), X(2), and X(3)
C       which provide the best fit (in the least squares sense) of
