C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. one can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties. If
C                             the position of a local difficulty can be
C                             determined (i.e. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval), it
C                             should be supplied to the routine as an
C                             element of the vector points. If necessary
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             must be used, which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.

C                             extrapolation table.
C                             It is presumed that the requested
C                             tolerance cannot be achieved, and that
C                             the returned RESULT is the best which
C                             can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. it must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.GT.0.
