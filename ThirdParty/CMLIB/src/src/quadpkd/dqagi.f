C***DESCRIPTION
C
C        Integration over infinite intervals
C        Standard fortran subroutine
C
C        PARAMETERS
C         ON ENTRY
C            F      - Double precision
C                     Function subprogram defining the integrand
C                     function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                     declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program.
C
C            BOUND  - Double precision
C                     Finite bound of integration range
C                     (has no meaning if interval is doubly-infinite)
C
C            INF    - Integer
C                     indicating the kind of integration range involved
C                     INF = 1 corresponds to  (BOUND,+INFINITY),
C                     INF = -1            to  (-INFINITY,BOUND),
C                     INF = 2             to (-INFINITY,+INFINITY).
C
C            EPSABS - Double precision
C                     Absolute accuracy requested
C            EPSREL - Double precision
C                     Relative accuracy requested
C                     If  EPSABS.LE.0
C                     and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28),
C                     the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C
C         ON RETURN
C            RESULT - Double precision
C                     Approximation to the integral
C
C            ABSERR - Double precision
C                     Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                     which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C            NEVAL  - Integer
C                     Number of integrand evaluations
C
C            IER    - Integer
C                     IER = 0 normal and reliable termination of the
C                             routine. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has been achieved.
C                   - IER.GT.0 abnormal termination of the routine. The
C                             estimates for result and error are less
C                             reliable. It is assumed that the requested
C                             accuracy has not been achieved.
C            ERROR MESSAGES
C                     IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed
C                             has been achieved. One can allow more
C                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
C                             LIMIT (and taking the according dimension
C                             adjustments into account). However, if
C                             this yields no improvement it is advised
C                             to analyze the integrand in order to
C                             determine the integration difficulties. If
C                             the position of a local difficulty can be
C                             determined (e.g. SINGULARITY,
C                             DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one
C                             will probably gain from splitting up the
C                             interval at this point and calling the
C                             integrator on the subranges. If possible,
C                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
C                             should be used, which is designed for
C                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
C                         = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is
C                             detected, which prevents the requested
C                             tolerance from being achieved.
C                             The error may be under-estimated.
C                         = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
C                             at some points of the integration
C                             interval.
C                         = 4 The algorithm does not converge.
C                             Roundoff error is detected in the
C                             extrapolation table.
C                             It is assumed that the requested tolerance
C                             cannot be achieved, and that the returned
C                             RESULT is the best which can be obtained.
C                         = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or
C                             slowly convergent. It must be noted that
C                             divergence can occur with any other value
C                             of IER.
C                         = 6 The input is invalid, because
C                             (EPSABS.LE.0 and
C                              EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28))
C                              or LIMIT.LT.1 or LENIW.LT.LIMIT*4.
C                             RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, LAST are set to
C                             zero. Exept when LIMIT or LENIW is
C                             invalid, IWORK(1), WORK(LIMIT*2+1) and
C                             WORK(LIMIT*3+1) are set to ZERO, WORK(1)
C                             is set to A and WORK(LIMIT+1) to B.
C
C         DIMENSIONING PARAMETERS
C            LIMIT - Integer
C                    Dimensioning parameter for IWORK
C                    LIMIT determines the maximum number of subintervals
C                    in the partition of the given integration interval
C                    (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1.
C                    If LIMIT.LT.1, the routine will end with IER = 6.
C
C            LENW  - Integer
C                    Dimensioning parameter for WORK
C                    LENW must be at least LIMIT*4.
C                    If LENW.LT.LIMIT*4, the routine will end
C                    with IER = 6.
C
C            LAST  - Integer
C                    On return, LAST equals the number of subintervals
C                    produced in the subdivision process, which
C                    determines the number of significant elements
C                    actually in the WORK ARRAYS.

C                    to the error estimates over the subintervals,
C                    such that WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(1)),... ,
C                    WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(K)) form a decreasing
C                    sequence, with K = LAST if LAST.LE.(LIMIT/2+2), and
C                    K = LIMIT+1-LAST otherwise
C
C            WORK  - Double precision
C                    Vector of dimension at least LENW
C                    on return
C                    WORK(1), ..., WORK(LAST) contain the left
C                     end points of the subintervals in the
C                     partition of (A,B),
C                    WORK(LIMIT+1), ..., WORK(LIMIT+LAST) Contain
C                     the right end points,
C                    WORK(LIMIT*2+1), ...,WORK(LIMIT*2+LAST) contain the
