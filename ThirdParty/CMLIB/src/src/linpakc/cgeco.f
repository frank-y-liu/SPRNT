C***PURPOSE  Factors a COMPLEX matrix by Gaussian elimination and

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CGECO factors a complex matrix by Gaussian elimination
C     and estimates the condition of the matrix.
C
C     If  RCOND  is not needed, CGEFA is slightly faster.
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow CGECO By CGESL.
C     To Compute  INVERSE(A)*C , follow CGECO by CGESL.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow CGECO by CGEDI.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow CGECO by CGEDI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       COMPLEX(LDA, N)
C                the matrix to be factored.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers
C                which were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = L*U  where
C                L  is a product of permutation and unit lower
C                triangular matrices and  U  is upper triangular.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        RCOND   REAL
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  A .
C                For the system  A*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  A  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  A  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.
C
C        Z       COMPLEX(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  A  is close to a singular matrix, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
