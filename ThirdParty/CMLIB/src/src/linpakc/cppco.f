C***PURPOSE  Factors a COMPLEX HERMITIAN POSITIVE DEFINITE matrix stored
C            in packed form and estimates the condition of the matrix.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CPPCO factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix
C     stored in packed form and estimates the condition of the matrix.
C
C     If  RCOND  is not needed, CPPFA is slightly faster.
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow CPPCO by CPPSL.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A)*C , follow CPPCO by CPPSL.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow CPPCO by CPPDI.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow CPPCO by CPPDI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the packed form of a Hermitian matrix  A .  The
C                columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially
C                in a one-dimensional array of length  N*(N+1)/2 .
C                See comments below for details.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        AP      an upper triangular matrix  R , stored in packed
C                form, so that  A = CTRANS(R)*R .
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
C
C        RCOND   REAL
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  A .
C                For the system  A*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  A  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  A  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.  If INFO .NE. 0 , RCOND is unchanged.
C
C        Z       COMPLEX(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  A  is singular to working precision, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , Z  is unchanged.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  signals an error condition.  The leading minor
C                     of order  K  is not positive definite.
C
C     Packed Storage
C

C          triangle of a Hermitian matrix.
