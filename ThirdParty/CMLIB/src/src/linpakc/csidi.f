C***PURPOSE  Computes the determinant and inverse of a COMPLEX SYMMETRIC
C            matrix using the factors from CSIFA.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CSIDI computes the determinant and inverse
C     of a complex symmetric matrix using the factors from CSIFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       COMPLEX(LDA,N)
C                the output from CSIFA.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix A .
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CSIFA.
C
C        WORK    COMPLEX(N)
C                work vector.  Contents destroyed.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                JOB has the decimal expansion  AB  where
C                   If  B .NE. 0, the inverse is computed,
C                   If  A .NE. 0, the determinant is computed,
C
C                For example, JOB = 11  gives both.
C
C     On Return
C
C        Variables not requested by JOB are not used.
C
C        A      contains the upper triangle of the inverse of
C               the original matrix.  The strict lower triangle
C               is never referenced.
C
C        DET    COMPLEX(2)
C               determinant of original matrix.
C               Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C               with 1.0 .LE. ABS(DET(1)) .LT. 10.0
C               or DET(1) = 0.0.
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero may occur if the inverse is requested
C        and  CSICO  has set RCOND .EQ. 0.0
C        or  CSIFA  has set  INFO .NE. 0 .
