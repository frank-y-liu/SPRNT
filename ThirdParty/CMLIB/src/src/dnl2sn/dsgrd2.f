C     ***  PURPOSE  ***
C
C        THIS SUBROUTINE USES AN EMBELLISHED FORM OF THE FINITE-DIFFER-
C     ENCE SCHEME PROPOSED BY STEWART (REF. 1) TO APPROXIMATE THE
C     GRADIENT OF THE FUNCTION F(X), WHOSE VALUES ARE SUPPLIED BY
C     REVERSE COMMUNICATION.
C
C     ***  PARAMETER DESCRIPTION  ***
C
C  ALPHA IN  (APPROXIMATE) DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF THE HESSIAN OF F(X).
C      D IN  SCALE VECTOR SUCH THAT D(I)*X(I), I = 1,...,N, ARE IN
C             COMPARABLE UNITS.
C   ETA0 IN  ESTIMATED BOUND ON RELATIVE ERROR IN THE FUNCTION VALUE...
C             (TRUE VALUE) = (COMPUTED VALUE)*(1+E),   WHERE
C             ABS(E) .LE. ETA0.
C     FX I/O ON INPUT,  FX  MUST BE THE COMPUTED VALUE OF F(X).  ON
C             OUTPUT WITH IRC = 0, FX HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL
C             VALUE, THE ONE IT HAD WHEN DSGRD2 WAS LAST CALLED WITH
C             IRC = 0.
C      G I/O ON INPUT WITH IRC = 0, G SHOULD CONTAIN AN APPROXIMATION
C             TO THE GRADIENT OF F NEAR X, E.G., THE GRADIENT AT THE
C             PREVIOUS ITERATE.  WHEN DSGRD2 RETURNS WITH IRC = 0, G IS
C             THE DESIRED FINITE-DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION TO THE
C             GRADIENT AT X.
C    IRC I/O INPUT/RETURN CODE... BEFORE THE VERY FIRST CALL ON DSGRD2,
C             THE CALLER MUST SET IRC TO 0.  WHENEVER DSGRD2 RETURNS A
C             NONZERO VALUE FOR IRC, IT HAS PERTURBED SOME COMPONENT OF
C             X... THE CALLER SHOULD EVALUATE F(X) AND CALL DSGRD2
C             AGAIN WITH FX = F(X).
C      N IN  THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES (COMPONENTS OF X) ON WHICH F
C             DEPENDS.
C      X I/O ON INPUT WITH IRC = 0, X IS THE POINT AT WHICH THE
C             GRADIENT OF F IS DESIRED.  ON OUTPUT WITH IRC NONZERO, X
C             IS THE POINT AT WHICH F SHOULD BE EVALUATED.  ON OUTPUT
C             WITH IRC = 0, X HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL VALUE
C             (THE ONE IT HAD WHEN DSGRD2 WAS LAST CALLED WITH IRC = 0)
C             AND G CONTAINS THE DESIRED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION.
C      W I/O WORK VECTOR OF LENGTH 6 IN WHICH DSGRD2 SAVES CERTAIN
C             QUANTITIES WHILE THE CALLER IS EVALUATING F(X) AT A
C             PERTURBED X.
C
C     ***  APPLICATION AND USAGE RESTRICTIONS  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH QUASI-NEWTON ROUTINES
C     FOR UNCONSTRAINED MINIMIZATION (IN WHICH CASE  ALPHA  COMES FROM
C     THE DIAGONAL OF THE QUASI-NEWTON HESSIAN APPROXIMATION).
C
C     ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        THIS CODE DEPARTS FROM THE SCHEME PROPOSED BY STEWART (REF. 1)
C     IN ITS GUARDING AGAINST OVERLY LARGE OR SMALL STEP SIZES AND ITS
C     HANDLING OF SPECIAL CASES (SUCH AS ZERO COMPONENTS OF ALPHA OR G).
