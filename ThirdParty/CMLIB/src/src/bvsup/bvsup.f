C **********************************************************************
C     Subroutine BVSUP solves a LINEAR two-point boundary-value problem
C     of the form
C                        dY/dX = MATRIX(X,U)*Y(X) + G(X,U)
C                A*Y(Xinitial) = ALPHA ,  B*Y(Xfinal) = BETA

C     Coupled with the solution of the initial value problem
C
C                        dU/dX = F(X,U)

C     Abstract
C        The method of solution uses superposition coupled with an
C     orthonormalization procedure and a variable-step integration
C     scheme.  Each time the superposition solutions start to
C     lose their numerical linear independence, the vectors are
C     reorthonormalized before integration proceeds.  The underlying
C     principle of the algorithm is then to piece together the
C     intermediate (orthogonalized) solutions, defined on the various
C     subintervals, to obtain the desired solutions.

C **********************************************************************
C
C     NROWY = Actual row dimension of Y in calling program.
C             NROWY must be .GE. NCOMP
C
C     NCOMP = Number of components per solution vector.
C             NCOMP is equal to number of original differential
C             equations.  NCOMP = NIC + NFC.
C
C     XPTS = Desired output points for solution. They must be monotonic.
C            Xinitial = XPTS(1)
C            Xfinal = XPTS(NXPTS)
C
C     NXPTS = Number of output points
C
C     A(NROWA,NCOMP) = Boundary condition matrix at Xinitial,
C                      must be contained in (NIC,NCOMP) sub-matrix.
C
C     NROWA = Actual row dimension of A in calling program,
C             NROWA must be .GE. NIC.
C
C     ALPHA(NIC+NEQIVP) = Boundary conditions at Xinitial.
C                         If NEQIVP .GT. 0 (see below), the boundary
C                         conditions at Xinitial for the initial value
C                         equations must be stored starting in
C                         position (NIC + 1) of ALPHA.
C                         Thus,  ALPHA(NIC+K) = ETA(K).
C
C     NIC = Number of boundary conditions at Xinitial.
C
C     B(NROWB,NCOMP) = Boundary condition matrix at Xfinal,
C                      must be contained in (NFC,NCOMP) sub-matrix.
C
C     NROWB = Actual row dimension of B in calling program,
C             NROWB must be .GE. NFC.
C
C     BETA(NFC) = Boundary conditions at Xfinal.
C
C     NFC = Number of boundary conditions at Xfinal
C
C     IGOFX =0 -- The inhomogeneous term G(X) is identically zero.
C           =1 -- The inhomogeneous term G(X) is not identically zero.
C                 (if IGOFX=1, then subroutine GVEC (or UVEC) must be
C                  supplied).
C
C     RE = Relative error tolerance used by the integrator
C          (see one of the integrators)
C
C     AE = Absolute error tolerance used by the integrator
C          (see one of the integrators)
C **NOTE-  RE and AE should not both be zero.
C
C     IFLAG = A status parameter used princpally for output.
C             However,for efficient solution of problems which
C             are originally defined as complex valued (but
C             converted to real systems to use this code),
C             the user must set IFLAG=13 on input. See the comment below
C             for more information on solving such problems.
C
C     WORK(NDW) = Floating point array used for internal storage.
C
C     NDW = Actual dimension of WORK array allocated by user.
C           An estimate for NDW can be computed from the following
C            NDW = 120 + NCOMP**2 * (6 + NXPTS/2 + expected number of
C                                                orthonormalizations/8)
C             For the DISK or TAPE storage mode,
C            NDW = 6 * NCOMP**2 + 10 * NCOMP + 120
C  However, when the ADAMS integrator is to be used, the estimates are
C            NDW = 120 + NCOMP**2 * (13 + NXPTS/2 + expected number of
C                                                orthonormalizations/8)
C    and     NDW = 13 * NCOMP**2 + 22 * NCOMP + 120   , respectively.
C
C     IWORK(NDIW) = Integer array used for internal storage.
C
C     NDIW = Actual dimension of IWORK array allocated by user.
C            An estimate for NDIW can be computed from the following
C            NDIW = 50 + NCOMP * (1 + expected number of
C                                        orthonormalizations)
C **NOTE --  The amount of storage required is problem dependent and may
C            be difficult to predict in advance. Experience has shown
C            that for most problems 20 or fewer orthonormalizations
C            should suffice. If the problem cannot be completed with the
C            allotted storage, then a message will be printed which
C            estimates the amount of storage necessary. In any case,the
C            user can examine the IWORK array for the actual storage
C            requirements,as described in the output information below.
C
C     NEQIVP = Number of auxiliary initial value equations being added
C              to the boundary value problem.
C **NOTE -- Occasionally the coefficients  MATRIX  and/or  G  may be
C           functions which depend on the independent variable  X  and
C           on  U, the solution of an auxiliary initial value problem.
C           In order to avoid the difficulties associated with
C           interpolation, the auxiliary equations may be solved
C           simultaneously with the given boundary value problem.
C           This initial value problem may be LINEAR or NONLINEAR.
C                 See SAND77-1328 for an example.
C
C
C     The user must supply subroutines FMAT, GVEC, UIVP and UVEC, when
C     needed (they MUST be so named), to evaluate the derivatives
C     as follows
C
C        A. FMAT must be supplied.
C
C              SUBROUTINE FMAT(X,Y,YP)
C              X = Independent variable (input to FMAT)
C              Y = Dependent variable vector (input to FMAT)
C              YP = dY/dX = Derivative vector (output from FMAT)
C
C            Compute the derivatives for the HOMOGENEOUS problem
C              YP(I) = dY(I)/dX = MATRIX(X) * Y(I)  , I = 1,...,NCOMP
C
C            When (NEQIVP .GT. 0) and  MATRIX  is dependent on  U  as
C            well as on  X, the following common statement must be
C            included in FMAT
C                    COMMON /MLIVP/ NOFST
C            For convenience, the  U  vector is stored at the bottom
C            of the  Y  array.  Thus, during any call to FMAT,
C            U(I) is referenced by  Y(NOFST + I).
C
C
C            Subroutine BVDER calls FMAT NFC times to evaluate the
C            homogeneous equations and, if necessary, it calls FMAT once
C            in evaluating the particular solution. Since X remains
C            unchanged in this sequence of calls it is possible to
C            realize considerable computational savings for complicated
C            and expensive evaluations of the MATRIX entries. To do this
C            the user merely passes a variable, say XS, via COMMON where
C            XS is defined in the main program to be any value except
C            the initial X. Then the non-constant elements of MATRIX(X)
C            appearing in the differential equations need only be
C            computed if X is unequal to XS, whereupon XS is reset to X.
C
C
C        B. If  NEQIVP .GT. 0 ,  UIVP must also be supplied.
C
C              SUBROUTINE UIVP(X,U,UP)
C              X = Independent variable (input to UIVP)
C              U = Dependent variable vector (input to UIVP)
C              UP = dU/dX = Derivative vector (output from UIVP)
C
C            Compute the derivatives for the auxiliary initial value eqs
C              UP(I) = dU(I)/dX, I = 1,...,NEQIVP.
C
C            Subroutine BVDER calls UIVP once to evaluate the
C            derivatives for the auxiliary initial value equations.
C
C
C        C. If  NEQIVP = 0  and  IGOFX = 1 ,  GVEC must be supplied.
C
C              SUBROUTINE GVEC(X,G)
C              X = Independent variable (input to GVEC)
C              G = Vector of inhomogeneous terms G(X) (output from GVEC)
C
C            Compute the inhomogeneous terms G(X)
C                G(I) = G(X) values for I = 1,...,NCOMP.
C
C            Subroutine BVDER calls GVEC in evaluating the particular
C            solution provided G(X) is NOT identically zero. Thus, when
C            IGOFX=0, the user need NOT write a GVEC subroutine. Also,
C            the user does not have to bother with the computational
C            savings scheme for GVEC as this is automatically achieved
C            via the BVDER subroutine.
C
C
C        D. If  NEQIVP .GT. 0  and  IGOFX = 1 ,  UVEC must be supplied.
C
C              SUBROUTINE UVEC(X,U,G)
C              X = Independent variable (input to UVEC)
C              U = Dependent variable vector from the auxiliary initial
C                  value problem    (input to UVEC)
C              G = Array of inhomogeneous terms G(X,U)(output from UVEC)
C
C            Compute the inhomogeneous terms G(X,U)
C                G(I) = G(X,U) values for I = 1,...,NCOMP.
C
C            Subroutine BVDER calls UVEC in evaluating the particular
C            solution provided G(X,U) is NOT identically zero.  Thus,
C            when IGOFX=0, the user need NOT write a UVEC subroutine.
C

C     The following is optional input to BVSUP to give the user more
C     flexibility in use of the code.  See SAND75-0198 , SAND77-1328 ,
C     SAND77-1690,SAND78-0522, and SAND78-1501 for more information.
C
C ****CAUTION -- The user MUST zero out IWORK(1),...,IWORK(15)
C                prior to calling BVSUP. These locations define optional
C                input and MUST be zero UNLESS set to special values by
C                the user as described below.

C     IWORK(1) -- Number of orthonormalization points.
C                 A value need be set only if IWORK(11) = 1

C                 (default value is 1)
C                 1 = RUNGE-KUTTA-FEHLBERG code using GRAM-SCHMIDT test.

C                     output points and orthonormalization information
C                     are stored on DISK.  The logical unit number to be
C                     used for DISK I/O (NTAPE) is set to IWORK(12).

C       Suppose the original boundary value problem is NC equations

C     where all variables are complex valued. The BVSUP code can be
C     used by converting to a real system of size 2*NC. To solve the
C     larger dimensioned problem efficiently,the user must initialize
C     IFLAG=13 on input and order the vector components according to
C     Y(1)=real(W(1)),...,Y(NC)=real(W(NC)),Y(NC+1)=imag(W(1)),....,
