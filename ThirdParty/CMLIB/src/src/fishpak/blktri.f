C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutine BLKTRI Solves a System of Linear Equations of the Form
C
C          AN(J)*X(I,J-1) + AM(I)*X(I-1,J) + (BN(J)+BM(I))*X(I,J)
C
C          + CN(J)*X(I,J+1) + CM(I)*X(I+1,J) = Y(I,J)
C
C               for I = 1,2,...,M  and  J = 1,2,...,N.
C
C     I+1 and I-1 are evaluated modulo M and J+1 and J-1 modulo N, i.e.,
C
C          X(I,0) = X(I,N),  X(I,N+1) = X(I,1),
C          X(0,J) = X(M,J),  X(M+1,J) = X(1,J).
C
C     These equations usually result from the discretization of
C     separable elliptic equations.  Boundary conditions may be
C     Dirichlet, Neumann, or Periodic.

C     * * * * * * * * * *     ON INPUT     * * * * * * * * * *
C
C     IFLG
C       = 0  Initialization only.  Certain quantities that depend on NP,
C            N, AN, BN, and CN are computed and stored in the work
C            array  W.
C       = 1  The quantities that were computed in the initialization are
C            used to obtain the solution X(I,J).
C
C       NOTE   A call with IFLG=0 takes approximately one half the time
C              as a call with IFLG = 1  .  However, the
C              initialization does not have to be repeated unless NP, N,
C              AN, BN, or CN change.
C
C     NP
C       = 0  If AN(1) and CN(N) are not zero, which corresponds to
C            periodic boundary conditions.
C       = 1  If AN(1) and CN(N) are zero.
C
C     N
C       The number of unknowns in the J-direction. N must be greater
C       than 4. The operation count is proportional to MNlog2(N), hence
C       N should be selected less than or equal to M.
C
C     AN,BN,CN
C       One-dimensional arrays of length N that specify the coefficients
C       in the linear equations given above.
C
C     MP
C       = 0  If AM(1) and CM(M) are not zero, which corresponds to
C            periodic boundary conditions.
C       = 1  If AM(1) = CM(M) = 0  .
C
C     M
C       The number of unknowns in the I-direction. M must be greater
C       than 4.
C
C     AM,BM,CM
C       One-dimensional arrays of length M that specify the coefficients
C       in the linear equations given above.
C
C     IDIMY
C       The row (or first) dimension of the two-dimensional array Y as
C       it appears in the program calling BLKTRI.  This parameter is
C       used to specify the variable dimension of Y.  IDIMY must be at
C       least M.
C
C     Y
C       A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C       side of the linear system of equations given above.  Y must be
C       dimensioned at least M*N.
C
C     W
C       A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C       work space.
C             If NP=1 define K=INT(log2(N))+1 and set L=2**(K+1) then
C                     W must have dimension (K-2)*L+K+5+MAX(2N,6M)
C
C             If NP=0 define K=INT(log2(N-1))+1 and set L=2**(K+1) then
C                     W must have dimension (K-2)*L+K+5+2N+MAX(2N,6M)
C
C       **IMPORTANT** For purposes of checking, the required dimension
C                     of W is computed by BLKTRI and stored in W(1)
C                     in floating point format.

C
C     Y
C       Contains the solution X.
C
C     IERROR
C       An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C       for number zero, a solution is not attempted.
C
C       = 0  No error.
C       = 1  M is less than 5.
C       = 2  N is less than 5.
C       = 3  IDIMY is less than M.
C       = 4  BLKTRI failed while computing results that depend on the
C            coefficient arrays AN, BN, CN.  Check these arrays.
C       = 5  AN(J)*CN(J-1) is less than 0 for some J. Possible reasons
C            for this condition are
C            1. The arrays AN and CN are not correct.
C            2. Too large a grid spacing was used in the discretization
C               of the elliptic equation.
C            3. The linear equations resulted from a partial
C               differential equation which was not elliptic.
C
C     W
C       Contains intermediate values that must not be destroyed if
C       BLKTRI will be called again with IFLG=1.  W(1) contains the
C       number of locations required by W in floating point format.
