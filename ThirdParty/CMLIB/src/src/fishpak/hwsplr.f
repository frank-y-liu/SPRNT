C       and A must be non-negative.
C
C     M
C       The number of panels into which the interval (A,B) is
C       subdivided.  Hence, there will be M+1 grid points in the

C       where DR = (B-A)/M is the panel width. M must be greater than 3.
C
C     MBDCND
C       Indicates the type of boundary condition at R = A and R = B.
C
C       = 1  If the solution is specified at R = A and R = B.
C       = 2  If the solution is specified at R = A and the derivative of
C            the solution with respect to R is specified at R = B.
C       = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C            specified at R = A (see note below) and R = B.
C       = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C            specified at R = A (see note below) and the solution is
C            specified at R = B.
C       = 5  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the
C            solution is specified at R = B.
C       = 6  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the
C            derivative of the solution with respect to R is specified
C            at R = B.
C
C       NOTE:  If A = 0, do not use MBDCND = 3 or 4, but instead use
C              MBDCND = 1,2,5, or 6  .
C
C     BDA
C       A one-dimensional array of length N+1 that specifies the values
C       of the derivative of the solution with respect to R at R = A.
C       When MBDCND = 3 or 4,
C
C            BDA(J) = (d/dR)U(A,THETA(J)), J = 1,2,...,N+1  .
C
C       When MBDCND has any other value, BDA is a dummy variable.
C
C     BDB
C       A one-dimensional array of length N+1 that specifies the values
C       of the derivative of the solution with respect to R at R = B.
C       When MBDCND = 2,3, or 6,
C
C            BDB(J) = (d/dR)U(B,THETA(J)), J = 1,2,...,N+1  .

C       than D.
C
C     N
C       The number of panels into which the interval (C,D) is
C       subdivided.  Hence, there will be N+1 grid points in the
C       THETA-direction given by THETA(J) = C+(J-1)DTHETA for
C       J = 1,2,...,N+1, where DTHETA = (D-C)/N is the panel width.  N
C       must be greater than 3.
C
C     NBDCND
C       Indicates the type of boundary conditions at THETA = C and
C       at THETA = D.
C
C       = 0  If the solution is periodic in THETA, i.e.,
C            U(I,J) = U(I,N+J).
C       = 1  If the solution is specified at THETA = C and THETA = D
C            (see note below).
C       = 2  If the solution is specified at THETA = C and the
C            derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C            specified at THETA = D (see note below).
C       = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C            specified at THETA = C and the solution is specified at
C            THETA = D (see note below).
C
C       NOTE:  When NBDCND = 1,2, or 4, do not use MBDCND = 5 or 6
C              (the former indicates that the solution is specified at
C              R = 0, the latter indicates the solution is unspecified
C              at R = 0).  Use instead MBDCND = 1 or 2  .
C
C     BDC
C       A one-dimensional array of length M+1 that specifies the values
C       of the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA at
C       THETA = C.  When NBDCND = 3 or 4,
C
C            BDC(I) = (d/dTHETA)U(R(I),C), I = 1,2,...,M+1  .
C
C       When NBDCND has any other value, BDC is a dummy variable.
C
C     BDD
C       A one-dimensional array of length M+1 that specifies the values
C       of the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA at
C       THETA = D.  When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
C
C            BDD(I) = (d/dTHETA)U(R(I),D), I = 1,2,...,M+1  .
C
C       When NBDCND has any other value, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C     ELMBDA
C       The constant LAMBDA in the Helmholtz equation.  If
C       LAMBDA .LT. 0, a solution may not exist.  However, HWSPLR will
C       attempt to find a solution.
C
C     F
C       A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C       side of the Helmholtz equation and boundary values (if any).
C       For I = 2,3,...,M and J = 2,3,...,N
C
C            F(I,J) = F(R(I),THETA(J)).

C
C       F must be dimensioned at least (M+1)*(N+1).
C
C       NOTE
C
C       If the table calls for both the solution U and the right side F
C       at a corner then the solution must be specified.
C
C
C     IDIMF
C       The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C       program calling HWSPLR.  This parameter is used to specify the
C       variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M+1  .
C
C     W
C       A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C       work space.  W may require up to 4*(N+1) +
C       (13 + INT(log2(N+1)))*(M+1) locations.  The actual number of
C       locations used is computed by HWSPLR and is returned in location
C       W(1).
C
C
C             * * * * * *   On Output     * * * * * *
C
C     F
C       Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C       approximation for the grid point (R(I),THETA(J)),
C       I = 1,2,...,M+1, J = 1,2,...,N+1  .
C
C     PERTRB
C       If a combination of periodic, derivative, or unspecified
C       boundary conditions is specified for A poisson equation
C       (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a constant,
C       calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures that a solution
C       exists.  HWSPLR then computes this solution, which is a least
C       squares solution to the original approximation.  This solution
C       plus any constant is also a solution.  Hence, the solution is
C       not unique.  PERTRB should be small compared to the right side.
C       Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an essentially different
C       problem.  This comparison should always be made to insure that a
C       meaningful solutin has been obtained.
C
C     IERROR
C       An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.  Except
C       for numbers 0 and 11, a solution is not attempted.
C
C       =  0  No error.
C       =  1  A .LT. 0  .
C       =  2  A .GE. B.
C       =  3  MBDCND .LT. 1 or MBDCND .GT. 6  .
C       =  4  C .GE. D.
C       =  5  N .LE. 3
C       =  6  NBDCND .LT. 0 or .GT. 4  .
C       =  7  A = 0, MBDCND = 3 or 4  .
C       =  8  A .GT. 0, MBDCND .GE. 5  .
C       =  9  MBDCND .GE. 5, NBDCND .NE. 0 and NBDCND .NE. 3  .
C       = 10  IDIMF .LT. M+1  .
C       = 11  LAMBDA .GT. 0  .
C       = 12  M .LE. 3
C
C       Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly incorrect
C       call to HWSPLR, the user should test IERROR after the call.
C
C     W
C       W(1) contains the required length of W.

C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HWSPLR is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N), but also depends on the input
