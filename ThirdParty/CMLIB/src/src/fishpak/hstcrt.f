C      and Y = D.
C

C
C               BDC(I) = (d/dY)U(X(I),C),     I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 0, BDC is a dummy variable.
C

C      A one-dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary

C
C      When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
C
C               BDD(I) = (d/dY)U(X(I),D) ,    I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 0, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C    ELMBDA
C      The constant LAMBDA in the Helmholtz equation.  If LAMBDA is
C      greater than 0, a solution may not exist.  However, HSTCRT will
C      attempt to find a solution.
C
C    F
C      A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C      side of the Helmholtz equation.  For I=1,2,...,M and J=1,2,...,N
C
C               F(I,J) = F(X(I),Y(J)) .
C
C      F must be dimensioned at least M X N.
C
C    IDIMF
C      The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C      program calling HSTCRT.  This parameter is used to specify the
C      variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M.
C
C    W
C      A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C      work space.  W may require up to 13M + 4N + M*INT(log2(N))
C      locations.  The actual number of locations used is computed by
C      HSTCRT and is returned in the location W(1).
C
C
C             * * * * * *   On Output   * * * * * *
C
C    F
C      Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C      approximation for the grid point (X(I),Y(J)) for
C      I=1,2,...,M, J=1,2,...,N.
C
C    PERTRB
C      If a combination of periodic or derivative boundary conditions is
C      specified for a Poisson equation (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not
C      exist.  PERTRB is a constant, calculated and subtracted from F,
C      which ensures that a solution exists.  HSTCRT then computes this
C      solution, which is a least squares solution to the original
C      approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also a
C      solution; hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of PERTRB
C      should be small compared to the right side F.  Otherwise, a
C      solution is obtained to an essentially different problem.  This
C      comparison should always be made to insure that a meaningful
C      solution has been obtained.
C
C    IERROR
C      An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.
C       Except for numbers 0 and  6, a solution is not attempted.
C
C      =  0  No error
C
C      =  1  A .GE. B
C
C      =  2  MBDCND .LT. 0 or MBDCND .GT. 4
C
C      =  3  C .GE. D
C
C      =  4  N .LE. 2
C
C      =  5  NBDCND .LT. 0 or NBDCND .GT. 4

C      =  6  LAMBDA .GT. 0
C
C      =  7  IDIMF .LT. M
C
C      =  8  M .LE. 2
C
C      Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly
C      incorrect call to HSTCRT, the user should test IERROR after
C      the call.
C
C    W
C      W(1) contains the required length of W.

C
C     Algorithm      This subroutine defines the finite-difference
C                    equations, incorporates boundary data, adjusts the
C                    right side when the system is singular and calls
C                    either POISTG or GENBUN which solves the linear
C                    system of equations.

C
C     Timing and        The execution time T on the NCAR Control Data
C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HSTCRT is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N).  Some typical values are listed in
C                    the table below.
C                       The solution process employed results in a loss
C                    of no more than FOUR significant digits for N and M
C                    as large as 64.  More detailed information about
C                    accuracy can be found in the documentation for
C                    subroutine POISTG which is the routine that
C                    actually solves the finite difference equations.
