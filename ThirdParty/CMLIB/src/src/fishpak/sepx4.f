C
C                          If IORDER=2, the user may equivalence GRHS
C                          and USOL to save space.  Note that in this
C                          case the tables specifying the boundaries of
C                          the GRHS and USOL arrays determine the
C                          boundaries uniquely except at the corners.
C                          If the tables call for both G(X,Y) and
C                          U(X,Y) at a corner then the solution must be
C                          chosen.  For example, if MBDCND=2 and
C                          NBDCND=4, then U(A,C), U(A,D), U(B,D) must be
C                          chosen at the corners in addition to G(B,C).
C
C                          If IORDER=4, then the two arrays, USOL and
C                          GRHS, must be distinct.
C
C                          USOL should be dimensioned IDMN by at least
C                          N+1 in the calling routine.
C
C                        IDMN
C                          The row (or first) dimension of the arrays
C                          GRHS and USOL as it appears in the program
C                          calling SEPX4.  This parameter is used to
C                          specify the variable dimension of GRHS and
C                          USOL.  IDMN must be at least 7 and greater
C                          than or equal to M+1.
C
C                        W
C                        A one-dimensional array that must be provided
C                        by the user for work space.
C                        10*N+(16+INT(log2(N)))*(M+1)+23 will suffice
C                        as a length for W.  The actual length of
C                        W in the calling routine must be set in W(1)
C                        (see IERROR=11).
C
C On Output              USOL
C                          Contains the approximate solution to the
C                          elliptic equation.  USOL(I,J) is the
C                          approximation to U(XI,YJ) for I=1,2...,M+1
C                          and J=1,2,...,N+1.  The approximation has
C                          error O(DLX**2+DLY**2) if called with
C                          IORDER=2 and O(DLX**4+DLY**4) if called with
C                          IORDER=4.
C
C                        W
C                          Contains intermediate values that must not be
C                          destroyed if SEPX4 is called again with
C                          INTL=1.  In addition W(1) contains the exact
C                          minimal length (in floating point) required
C                          for the work space (see IERROR=11).
C
C                       PERTRB
C                        If a combination of periodic or derivative
C                        boundary conditions (i.e., ALPHA=BETA=0 if
C                        MBDCND=3) is specified and if CF(X)=0 for all X
C                        then a solution to the discretized matrix
C                        equation may not exist (reflecting the non-
C                        uniqueness of solutions to the pde).  PERTRB
C                        is a constant calculated and subtracted from
C                        the right hand side of the matrix equation
C                        insuring the existence of a solution.
C                        SEPX4 computes this solution which is a
C                        weighted minimal least squares solution to
C                        the original problem.  If singularity is
C                        not detected PERTRB=0.0 is returned by
C                        SEPX4.
C
C                        IERROR
C                          An error flag that indicates invalid input
C                          parameters or failure to find a solution
C                          = 0 No error
C                          = 1 If A greater than B or C greater than D

C                          = 9 If INTL is not 0 or 1

C                               space length required output in W(1).
C                        = 12 If MBDCND=0 and AF(X)=CF(X)=constant
C                             or BF(X)=0 for all X is not true.

C
C History                SEPX4 was developed by modifying the ULIB
C                        routine SEPELI during October 1978.
C                        It should be used instead of SEPELI whenever
C                        possible.  The increase in speed is at least
C                        a factor of three.
C
C Algorithm              SEPX4 automatically discretizes the separable
C                        elliptic equation which is then solved by a
C                        generalized cyclic reduction algorithm in the
C                        subroutine POIS.  The fourth order solution
C                        is obtained using the technique of
C                        defferred corrections referenced below.
