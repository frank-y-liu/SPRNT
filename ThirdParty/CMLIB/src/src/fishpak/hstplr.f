C
C    A,B
C      The range of R, i.e. A .LE. R .LE. B.  A must be less than B and
C      A must be non-negative.
C
C    M
C      The number of grid points in the interval (A,B).  The grid points
C      in the R-direction are given by R(I) = A + (I-0.5)DR for
C      I=1,2,...,M where DR =(B-A)/M.  M must be greater than 2.
C
C    MBDCND
C      Indicates the type of boundary conditions at R = A and R = B.
C
C      = 1  If the solution is specified at R = A and R = B.
C
C      = 2  If the solution is specified at R = A and the derivative
C           of the solution with respect to R is specified at R = B.
C           (see note 1 below)
C
C      = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C           specified at R = A (see note 2 below) and R = B.
C
C      = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
C           specified at R = A (see note 2 below) and the solution is
C           specified at R = B.
C
C      = 5  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the solution
C           is specified at R = B.
C
C      = 6  If the solution is unspecified at R = A = 0 and the
C           derivative of the solution with respect to R is specified at
C           R = B.
C
C      NOTE 1:  If A = 0, MBDCND = 2, and NBDCND = 0 or 3, the system of
C               equations to be solved is singular.  The unique solution
C               is determined by extrapolation to the specification of
C               U(0,THETA(1)).  But in this case the right side of the
C               system will be perturbed by the constant PERTRB.
C
C      NOTE 2:  If A = 0, do not use MBDCND = 3 or 4, but instead use
C               MBDCND = 1,2,5, or 6.
C
C    BDA
C      A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
C      values (if any) of the solution at R = A.  When MBDCND = 1 or 2,
C
C               BDA(J) = U(A,THETA(J)) ,          J=1,2,...,N.
C
C      When MBDCND = 3 or 4,
C
C               BDA(J) = (d/dR)U(A,THETA(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
C
C      When MBDCND = 5 or 6, BDA is a dummy variable.
C
C    BDB
C      A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
C      values of the solution at R = B.  When MBDCND = 1,4, or 5,
C
C               BDB(J) = U(B,THETA(J)) ,          J=1,2,...,N.
C
C      When MBDCND = 2,3, or 6,
C
C               BDB(J) = (d/dR)U(B,THETA(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
C
C    C,D
C      The range of THETA, i.e. C .LE. THETA .LE. D.  C must be less
C      than D.
C
C    N
C      The number of unknowns in the interval (C,D).  The unknowns in
C      the THETA-direction are given by THETA(J) = C + (J-0.5)DT,
C      J=1,2,...,N, where DT = (D-C)/N.  N must be greater than 2.
C
C    NBDCND
C      Indicates the type of boundary conditions at THETA = C
C      and THETA = D.
C
C      = 0  If the solution is periodic in THETA, i.e.
C           U(I,J) = U(I,N+J).
C
C      = 1  If the solution is specified at THETA = C and THETA = D
C           (see note below).
C
C      = 2  If the solution is specified at THETA = C and the derivative
C           of the solution with respect to THETA is specified at
C           THETA = D (see note below).
C
C      = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C           specified at THETA = C and THETA = D.
C
C      = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
C           specified at THETA = C and the solution is specified at
C           THETA = d (see note below).
C
C      NOTE:  When NBDCND = 1, 2, or 4, do not use MBDCND = 5 or 6 (the
C      former indicates that the solution is specified at R =  0; the
C      latter indicates the solution is unspecified at R = 0).  Use
C      instead MBDCND = 1 or 2.
C
C    BDC
C      A one dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
C      values of the solution at THETA = C.   When NBDCND = 1 or 2,
C
C               BDC(I) = U(R(I),C) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 3 or 4,
C
C               BDC(I) = (d/dTHETA)U(R(I),C),     I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 0, BDC is a dummy variable.
C
C    BDD
C      A one-dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
C      values of the solution at THETA = D.  When NBDCND = 1 or 4,
C
C               BDD(I) = U(R(I),D) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
C
C               BDD(I) = (d/dTHETA)U(R(I),D) ,    I=1,2,...,M.
C
C      When NBDCND = 0, BDD is a dummy variable.
C
C    ELMBDA
C      The constant LAMBDA in the Helmholtz equation.  If LAMBDA is
C      greater than 0, a solution may not exist.  However, HSTPLR will
C      attempt to find a solution.
C
C    F
C      A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
C      side of the Helmholtz equation.  For I=1,2,...,M and J=1,2,...,N
C
C               F(I,J) = F(R(I),THETA(J)) .
C
C      F must be dimensioned at least M X N.
C
C    IDIMF
C      The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
C      program calling HSTPLR.  This parameter is used to specify the
C      variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M.
C
C    W
C      A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
C      work space.  W may require up to 13M + 4N + M*INT(log2(N))
C      locations.  The actual number of locations used is computed by
C      HSTPLR and is returned in the location W(1).
C
C
C             * * * * * *   On Output   * * * * * *
C
C    F
C      Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
C      approximation for the grid point (R(I),THETA(J)) for
C      I=1,2,...,M, J=1,2,...,N.
C
C    PERTRB
C      If a combination of periodic, derivative, or unspecified
C      boundary conditions is specified for a Poisson equation
C      (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a con-
C      stant, calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures
C      that a solution exists.  HSTPLR then computes this
C      solution, which is a least squares solution to the
C      original approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also
C      a solution; hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of
C      PERTRB should be small compared to the right side F.
C      Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an essentially different
C      problem.  This comparison should always be made to insure that
C      a meaningful solution has been obtained.
C
C    IERROR
C      An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.
C      Except for numbers 0 and 11, a solution is not attempted.
C
C      =  0  No error
C
C      =  1  A .LT. 0
C
C      =  2  A .GE. B
C
C      =  3  MBDCND .LT. 1 or MBDCND .GT. 6
C
C      =  4  C .GE. D
C
C      =  5  N .LE. 2
C
C      =  6  NBDCND .LT. 0 or NBDCND .GT. 4
C
C      =  7  A = 0 and MBDCND = 3 or 4
C
C      =  8  A .GT. 0 and MBDCND .GE. 5
C
C      =  9  MBDCND .GE. 5 and NBDCND .NE. 0 or 3
C
C      = 10  IDIMF .LT. M
C
C      = 11  LAMBDA .GT. 0
C
C      = 12  M .LE. 2
C
C      Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly
C      incorrect call to HSTPLR, the user should test IERROR after
C      the call.
C
C    W
C      W(1) contains the required length of W.

C
C     Algorithm      This subroutine defines the finite-difference
C                    equations, incorporates boundary data, adjusts the
C                    right side when the system is singular and calls
C                    either POISTG or GENBUN which solves the linear
C                    system of equations.

C     Accuracy       7600 for subroutine HSTPLR is roughly proportional
C                    to M*N*log2(N).  Some typical values are listed in
C                    the table below.
C                       The solution process employed results in a loss
C                    of no more than four significant digits for N and M
C                    as large as 64.  More detailed information about
C                    accuracy can be found in the documentation for
