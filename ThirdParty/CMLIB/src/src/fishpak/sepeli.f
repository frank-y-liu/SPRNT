C                        USOL
C                          A two-dimensional array that specifies the

C
C                          If IORDER=2, the user may equivalence GRHS
C                          and USOL to save space.  Note that in this
C                          case the tables specifying the boundaries of
C                          the GRHS and USOL arrays determine the
C                          boundaries uniquely except at the corners.
C                          If the tables call for both G(X,Y) and
C                          U(X,Y) at a corner then the solution must be
C                          chosen.  For example, if MBDCND=2 and
C                          NBDCND=4, then U(A,C), U(A,D), U(B,D) must be
C                          chosen at the corners in addition to G(B,C).
C
C                          If IORDER=4, then the two arrays, USOL and
C                          GRHS, must be distinct.
C
C                          USOL should be dimensioned IDMN by at least
C                          N+1 in the calling routine.
C
C                        IDMN
C                          The row (or first) dimension of the arrays
C                          GRHS and USOL as it appears in the program
C                          calling SEPELI.  This parameter is used to
C                          specify the variable dimension of GRHS and
C                          USOL.  IDMN must be at least 7 and greater
C                          than or equal to M+1.
C
C                        W
C                          A one-dimensional array that must be provided
C                          by the user for work space.  Let
C                          K=INT(log2(N+1))+1 and set  L=2**(K+1).
C                          then (K-2)*L+K+10*N+12*M+27 will suffice
C                          as a length of W.  THE actual length of W in
C                          the calling routine must be set in W(1) (see
C                          IERROR=11).
C
C On Output              USOL
C                          Contains the approximate solution to the
C                          elliptic equation.  USOL(I,J) is the
C                          approximation to U(XI,YJ) for I=1,2...,M+1
C                          and J=1,2,...,N+1.  The approximation has
C                          error O(DLX**2+DLY**2) if called with
C                          IORDER=2 and O(DLX**4+DLY**4) if called with
C                          IORDER=4.
C
C                        W
C                          Contains intermediate values that must not be
C                          destroyed if SEPELI is called again with
C                          INTL=1.  In addition W(1) contains the exact
C                          minimal length (in floating point) required
C                          for the work space (see IERROR=11).
C
C                        PERTRB
C                          If a combination of periodic or derivative
C                          boundary conditions (i.e., ALPHA=BETA=0 if
C                          MBDCND=3; GAMA=XNU=0 if NBDCND=3) is
C                          specified and if the coefficients of U(X,Y)
C                          in the separable elliptic equation are zero
C                          (i.e., CF(X)=0 for X greater than or equal to
C                          A and less than or equal to B; FF(Y)=0 for
C                          Y greater than or equal to C and less than
C                          or equal to D) then a solution may not exist.
C                          PERTRB is a constant calculated and
C                          subtracted from the right-hand side of the
C                          matrix equations generated by SEPELI which
C                          insures that a solution exists.  SEPELI then
C                          computes this solution which is a weighted
C                          minimal least squares solution to the
C                          original problem.
C
C                        IERROR
C                          An error flag that indicates invalid input
C                          parameters or failure to find a solution
C                          = 0 No error
C                          = 1 If A greater than B or C greater than D

C                          = 4 If attempt to find a solution fails.

C                          = 7 If N is too small (see discussion of N)
C                          = 8 If IORDER is not 2 or 4
C                          = 9 If INTL is not 0 or 1
C                          = 10 If AFUN*DFUN less than or equal to 0 for
C                               some interior mesh point (XI,YJ)
C                          = 11 If the work space length input in W(1)
C                               is less than the exact minimal work
C                               space length required output in W(1).
C
C                          NOTE (concerning IERROR=4):  for the
C                          coefficients input through COFX, COFY, the
C                          discretization may lead to a block
C                          tridiagonal linear system which is not
C                          diagonally dominant (for example, this
C                          happens if CFUN=0 and BFUN/(2.*DLX) greater
C                          than AFUN/DLX**2).  In this case solution may
C                          fail.  This cannot happen in the limit as
C                          DLX, DLY approach zero.  Hence, the condition
C                          may be remedied by taking larger values for M
C                          or N.

C Algorithm              SEPELI automatically discretizes the separable
C                        elliptic equation which is then solved by a
C                        generalized cyclic reduction algorithm in the
C                        subroutine, BLKTRI.  The fourth-order solution
C                        is obtained using 'Deferred Corrections' which
C                        is described and referenced in sections,
C                        references and method.

C Accuracy and Timing    The following computational results were
C                        obtained by solving the sample problem at the
C                        end of this write-up on the Control Data 7600.
C                        The op count is proportional to M*N*log2(N).
C                        In contrast to the other routines in this
C                        chapter, accuracy is tested by computing and
C                        tabulating second- and fourth-order
C                        discretization errors.  Below is a table
C                        containing computational results.  The times
C                        given do not include initialization (i.e.,
C                        times are for INTL=1).  Note that the
C                        fourth-order accuracy is not realized until the
C                        mesh is sufficiently refined.
