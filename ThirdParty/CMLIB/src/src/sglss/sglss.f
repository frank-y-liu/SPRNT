C***AUTHOR  MANTEUFFEL, T. A., (LANL)
C***PURPOSE  Solves LINEAR LEAST SQUARES problems by performing
C            a QR factorization of the matrix A using Householder
C            transformations. Emphasis is put on detecting possible
C            rank deficiency.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SGLSS solves both underdetermined and overdetermined
C     LINEAR systems AX = B, where A is an M by N matrix
C     and B is an M by NB matrix of right hand sides. If
C     M.GE.N, the least squares solution is computed by
C     decomposing the matrix A into the product of an
C     orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix
C     R (QR factorization). If M.LT.N, the minimal
C     length solution is computed by factoring the
C     matrix A into the product of a lower triangular
C     matrix L and an orthogonal matrix Q (LQ factor-
C     ization). If the matrix A is determined to be rank
C     deficient, that is the rank of A is less than
C     MIN(M,N), then the minimal length least squares
C     solution is computed.
C
C     SGLSS assumes full machine precision in the data.
C     If more control over the uncertainty in the data
C     is desired, the codes LLSIA and ULSIA are
C     recommended.
C
C     SGLSS requires MDA*N + (MDB + 1)*NB + 5*MIN(M,N) dimensioned
C     real space and M+N dimensioned integer space.
