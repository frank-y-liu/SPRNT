C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Written by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon
C
C   Abstract
C
C   Subroutine  STEP2  is normally used indirectly through subroutine
C   DEABM .  Because  DEABM  suffices for most problems and is much
C   easier to use, using it should be considered before using  STEP2
C   alone.
C
C   Subroutine STEP2 integrates a system of  NEQN  first order ordinary
C   differential equations one step, normally from X to X+H, using a
C   modified divided difference form of the Adams PECE formulas.  Local
C   extrapolation is used to improve absolute stability and accuracy.
C   The code adjusts its order and step size to control the local error
C   per unit step in a generalized sense.  Special devices are included
C   to control roundoff error and to detect when the user is requesting
C   too much accuracy.
C
C   This code is completely explained and documented in the text,
C   Computer Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, the Initial
C   Value Problem  by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon.
C   Further details on use of this code are available in "Solving
C   Ordinary Differential Equations with ODE, STEP, and INTRP",
C   by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon, SLA-73-1060.
C
C
C   The Parameters Represent --
C      F -- subroutine to evaluate derivatives
C      NEQN -- number of equations to be integrated
C      Y(*) -- solution vector at X
C      X -- independent variable
C      H -- appropriate step size for next step.  Normally determined by
C           code
C      EPS -- local error tolerance
C      WT(*) -- vector of weights for error criterion
C      start -- logical variable set .TRUE. for first step,  .FALSE.
C           otherwise
C      HOLD -- step size used for last successful step
C      K -- appropriate order for next step (determined by code)
C      KOLD -- order used for last successful step
C      CRASH -- logical variable set .TRUE. when no step can be taken,
C           .FALSE. otherwise.
C      YP(*) -- derivative of solution vector at  X  after successful
C           step
C      KSTEPS -- counter on attempted steps
C      TWOU -- 2.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
C      FOURU -- 4.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
C      RPAR,IPAR -- parameter arrays which you may choose to use
C            for communication between your program and subroutine F.
C            They are not altered or used by STEP2.
C   The arrays  PHI, PSI  are required for the interpolation subroutine
C   INTRP .  The array  P  is internal to the code.  The remaining nine
C   variables and arrays are included in the call list only to eliminate
C   local retention of variables between calls.
C
C   Input to STEP2
C
C      First Call --
C
C   The user must provide storage in his calling program for all arrays
C   in the call list, namely
C
C     DIMENSION Y(NEQN),WT(NEQN),PHI(NEQN,16),P(NEQN),YP(NEQN),PSI(12),
C    1  ALPHA(12),BETA(12),SIG(13),V(12),W(12),G(13),RPAR(1),IPAR(1)
C
C    **Note**
C
C   The user must also declare  START ,  CRASH ,  PHASE1  and  NORND
C   logical variables and  F  an EXTERNAL subroutine, supply the
C   subroutine  F(X,Y,YP)  to evaluate
C      DY(I)/DX = YP(I) = F(X,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
C   and initialize only the following parameters.
C      NEQN -- number of equations to be integrated
C      Y(*) -- vector of initial values of dependent variables
C      X -- initial value of the independent variable
C      H -- nominal step size indicating direction of integration
C           and maximum size of step.  Must be variable
C      EPS -- local error tolerance per step.  Must be variable
C      WT(*) -- vector of non-zero weights for error criterion
C      START -- .TRUE.
C      KSTEPS -- set KSTEPS to zero
C      TWOU -- 2.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
C      FOURU -- 4.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
C   Define U to be the machine unit roundoff quantity by calling
C   the function routine  R1MACH,  U = R1MACH(4), or by
C   computing U so that U is the smallest positive number such
C   that 1.0+U .GT. 1.0.
C
C   STEP2  requires that the L2 norm of the vector with components
C   LOCAL ERROR(L)/WT(L)  be less than  EPS  for a successful step.  The
C   array  WT  allows the user to specify an error test appropriate
C   for his problem.  For example,
C      WT(L) = 1.0  specifies absolute error,
C            = ABS(Y(L))  error relative to the most recent value of the
C                 L-th component of the solution,
C            = ABS(YP(L))  error relative to the most recent value of
C                 the L-th component of the derivative,
C            = AMAX1(WT(L),ABS(Y(L)))  error relative to the largest
C                 magnitude of L-th component obtained so far,
C            = ABS(Y(L))*RELERR/EPS + ABSERR/EPS  specifies a mixed
C                 relative-absolute test where  RELERR  is relative
C                 error,  ABSERR  is absolute error and  EPS =
C                 AMAX1(RELERR,ABSERR) .
C
C      Subsequent Calls --
C
C   Subroutine  STEP2  is designed so that all information needed to
C   continue the integration, including the step size  H  and the order
C   K , is returned with each step.  With the exception of the step
C   size, the error tolerance, and the weights, none of the parameters
C   should be altered.  The array  WT  must be updated after each step
C   to maintain relative error tests like those above.  Normally the
C   integration is continued just beyond the desired endpoint and the
C   solution interpolated there with subroutine  INTRP .  If it is
C   impossible to integrate beyond the endpoint, the step size may be
C   reduced to hit the endpoint since the code will not take a step
C   larger than the  H  input.  Changing the direction of integration,
C   i.e., the sign of  H , requires the user set  START = .TRUE. before
C   calling  STEP2  again.  This is the only situation in which  START
C   should be altered.
C
C   Output from STEP2
C
C      Successful Step --
C
C   The subroutine returns after each successful step with  START  and
C   CRASH  set .FALSE. .  X  represents the independent variable
C   advanced one step of length  HOLD  from its value on input and  Y
C   the solution vector at the new vAlue of  X .  All other parameters
C   represent information corresponding to the new  X  needed to
C   continue the integration.
C
C      Unsuccessful Step --
C
C   When the error tolerance is too small for the machine precision,
C   the subroutine returns without taking a step and  CRASH = .TRUE. .
C   An appropriate step size and error tolerance for continuing are
C   estimated and all other information is restored as upon input
C   before returning.  To continue with the larger tolerance, the user
C   just calls the code again.  A restart is neither required nor
C   desirable.
