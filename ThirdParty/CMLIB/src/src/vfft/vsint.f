C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine VSINT computes the discrete Fourier sine transform
C  of M odd sequences X(J,I), J=1,...,M.  The transform is defined
C  below at output parameter X.
C
C  The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine VSINT must be
C  initialized by calling subroutine VSINTI(N,WSAVE).
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  M       the number of sequences to be transformed.
C
C  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.  The method
C          is most efficient when N+1 is the product of small primes.
C
C  X       an array of size at least X(MDIMX,N+1) which contains the
C          the sequences to be transformed.  The sequences are stored
C          in the ROWS of X.  Thus, the Jth sequence is stored in
C          X(J,I), I=1,..,N.  The extra column of X is used as work
C          storage.
C
C  XT      a work array of size at least XT(MDIMX,N+1).
C
C  MDIMX   the first dimension of the array X exactly as it appears in
C          the calling program.
C
C  WSAVE   a work array with dimension at least INT(2.5*N+15)
C          in the program that calls VSINT.  The WSAVE array must be
C          initialized by calling subroutine VSINTI(N,WSAVE), and a
C          different WSAVE array must be used for each different
C          value of N.  This initialization does not have to be
C          repeated so long as N remains unchanged.
C
C  Output Parameters
C
C  X       for I=1,...,N and J=1,...,M
C
C               X(J,I)= the sum from k=1 to k=N
C
C                    2*X(J,K)*SIN(K*I*PI/(N+1))/SQRT(2*(N+1))
C
C  WSAVE   contains initialization calculations which must not be
C          destroyed between calls of VSINT.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  NOTE  -  A call of VSINT followed immediately by another call
C           of VSINT will return the original sequences X.  Thus,
C           VSINT is the correctly normalized inverse of itself.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  VSINT is a straightforward extension of the subprogram SINT to
C  handle M simultaneous sequences.  The scaling of the sequences
C  computed by VSINT is different than that of SINT.  SINT was
C  orginally developed by P. N. Swarztrauber of NCAR.
