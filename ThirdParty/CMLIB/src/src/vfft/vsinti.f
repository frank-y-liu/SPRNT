C***AUTHOR  BOISVERT, R. F. (NBS)
C***PURPOSE  Initialize for VSINT.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine VSINTI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in
C  subroutine SINT.  The prime factorization of N together with
C  a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
C  stored in WSAVE.
C
C  Input Parameter
C
C  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.  The method
C          is most efficient when N+1 is a product of small primes.
C
C  Output Parameter
C
C  WSAVE   a work array with at least INT(2.5*N+15) locations.
C          Different WSAVE arrays are required for different values
C          of N.  The contents of WSAVE must not be changed between
C          calls of VSINT.

C  VSINTI is a straightforward extension of the subprogram SINTI to
C  handle M simultaneous sequences.  SINTI was originally developed
C  P. N. Swarztrauber of NCAR.
