1. mass conservation based bounding to avoid Gibbs 

2. introduce "reach" into overall data structure

1. Check and correct the computation of critical depth, as well as the computation
   of the Froude number

2. Experiment: make a small case of transcritical (sub->super) and visualize the 
   directions of Jacobian
