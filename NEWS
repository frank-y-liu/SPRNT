April 2014, ver 1.2.2
 - initial release. core functions: topology check, compute steady state 
   solution, compute unsteady state solution.
 - the river stream network can be specified in the "netlist" format.
 - supports API mode, users can construct the river networks in 
   memory, simulate to a certain time point, pause, update forcing terms,
   and proceed to another time point, and so on. 

December 2014, ver 1.2.3
 - Added a separate driver to enable "rolling" simulation, basically a quick-
   and-dirty way of API function. It will not be automatically built.

April 2015, ver 1.2.9
 - New initial condition computation method 
 - Various bug fixes

June 2015, ver 1.3.1
 - Added support of INTRINSIC x-section specification. Instead of surveyed geometrical
   data (trapezoidal, Y-Z pairs), the x-section can be specified by A(wetted area)-P(
   wetted perimeter), A-Y(depth) and A-W(free surface width).
