SPRNT is a river dynamics simulation software package. Technically it is a fully dynamic
Saint Venant Equation solver. Quite a few nice tricks are developed to make SPRNT not 
only fast but also capable of handling large networks. The code is written by Dr. Frank Liu 
from IBM Research, as a result of academic collaborations with Professor Ben Hodges in 
the Civil Engineering Department of University of Texas at Austin. It is released under 
Eclipse Public License. IBM owns the copyright.
